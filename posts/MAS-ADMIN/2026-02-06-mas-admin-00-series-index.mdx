# MAS ADMIN Series: The Complete Guide to Maximo Administration in the Cloud-Native Era

> **Who this is for:** Maximo administrators at any stage of the MAS transition -- whether you are still running 7.6, planning a migration, or already operating MAS in production. This series is your comprehensive guide to understanding, preparing for, and thriving in the new MAS admin role.

**Total series read time: ~3 hours across 8 parts**

---

## Why This Series Exists

The transition from Maximo 7.x to MAS is the most significant shift in Maximo administration in two decades. IBM's documentation explains the technology. Red Hat's documentation explains OpenShift. But nobody wrote the guide that says: "Here is how your job changes, here is what you need to learn, and here is how to build a career in the new world."

This series fills that gap. Written by practitioners who have guided dozens of admin teams through the transition, it combines technical depth with the emotional honesty that this kind of professional change demands.

---

## The Series at a Glance

```
Part 1: Where you have been (Legacy 7.x)
Part 2: What the new job looks like (New Responsibilities)
Part 3: The SaaS admin experience (SaaS Deep Dive)
Part 4: The on-prem admin experience (On-Prem Deep Dive)
Part 5: What you need to learn (Skills Roadmap)

## Part-by-Part Guide

### Part 1: The Legacy Maximo Administrator Role: A Love Letter to the 7.x Era

**[Read Part 1 →](/blog/legacy-maximo-admin-role)**

**Read time:** 18 minutes

The foundation. Before we can talk about where the admin role is going, we need to honor where it has been. This post is a deep dive into the WebSphere configuration, EAR deployments, JVM tuning, direct SQL, and server-level troubleshooting that defined two decades of Maximo operations. If you have lived this life, you will recognize every scenario. If you are new, this is the context you need.

**You will learn:**
- What the traditional Maximo 7.x admin role looked like day to day
- How WebSphere, LDAP, MIF, and BIRT formed the core technical identity
- What MAS eliminates entirely vs. what transfers to the new world
- Why the emotional investment in legacy skills is real and valid

---

### Part 2: New Responsibilities in MAS: What SaaS and On-Prem Admins Actually Do Now

**[Read Part 2 →](/blog/new-mas-admin-responsibilities)**

**Read time:** 22 minutes

The overview of the new role. This post maps every legacy responsibility to its MAS equivalent and introduces the six core areas that define the modern MAS administrator: microservices awareness, Kubernetes literacy, operator management, API-first troubleshooting, Zero Trust security, and AppPoints licensing.

**You will learn:**
- The six core responsibility areas for MAS admins
- Essential `oc` commands you will use daily
- How operators replace manual deployment and upgrade processes
- The shared responsibility model (who owns what in MAS)
- How AppPoints licensing works and why it needs active management

---

### Part 3: How the SysAdmin Role Changes in MAS SaaS: From Server Room to Strategy Room

**[Read Part 3 →](/blog/sysadmin-role-mas-saas)**

**Read time:** 24 minutes

The emotional and practical reality of losing server access. This post addresses the SaaS admin experience directly -- including the five stages of losing server access, what fills the gap left by infrastructure work, how to work effectively with IBM Support, and why the SaaS admin role is a career evolution, not a demotion.

**You will learn:**
- What SaaS admins no longer do (and who does it instead)
- What SaaS admins do now: users, security, integrations, upgrades, licensing, governance
- A complete 90-day transition plan for new SaaS admins
- How to work effectively with IBM Support as a partnership
- Why SaaS admin skills are more portable and career-enhancing than legacy skills

---

### Part 4: How the SysAdmin Role Changes in MAS On-Prem

**[Read Part 4 →](/blog/sysadmin-role-mas-onprem)**

**Read time:** 18 minutes

The on-prem deep dive. MAS on-prem retains more technical depth than SaaS -- you still own the infrastructure. But the technology is completely different. This post covers OpenShift cluster administration, operator-driven deployments, certificate lifecycle management, storage classes, backup procedures, and the shared responsibility model with platform, DBA, security, and network teams.

**You will learn:**
- How OpenShift replaces WebSphere as your daily environment
- Certificate management as a critical new responsibility
- Storage classes, PVCs, and Kubernetes persistent storage
- Multi-layered backup procedures (etcd, MongoDB, CRs, PVs)
- The identity shift from sysadmin to platform engineer / SRE

---

### Part 5: Skills MAS SysAdmins Must Learn

**[Read Part 5 →](/blog/skills-mas-admins-need)**

**Read time:** 16 minutes

The learning roadmap. Organized by deployment model (SaaS vs. on-prem), priority level (critical vs. important vs. nice-to-have), and timeline (what to learn first, second, third). Includes certification recommendations, free and paid training resources, hands-on lab suggestions, and a self-assessment checklist.

**You will learn:**
- The complete skill matrix for SaaS and on-prem admin tracks
- A structured 12-month learning path with monthly milestones
- Which certifications matter most (CKA, RHCSA, IBM MAS Admin)
- Free and paid training resources ranked by quality
- How to build a team learning plan for organizational resilience

---

### Part 6: The Daily Toolset of MAS Admins

**[Read Part 6 →](/blog/daily-toolset-mas-admins)**

**Read time:** 17 minutes

Your new toolkit, explained. A hands-on tour of every tool MAS admins use daily -- from the MAS System Health Dashboard and `oc` CLI to Grafana dashboards and Prometheus alerting. Includes the complete Rosetta Stone mapping legacy tools to their MAS equivalents, a morning health check routine, and a troubleshooting decision tree.

**You will learn:**
- Every tool in the SaaS and on-prem admin toolkit with usage examples
- Essential `oc` CLI commands with real output examples
- How to build Grafana dashboards and Prometheus alerts for MAS
- The morning health check routine (SaaS: 15 min, On-Prem: 30 min)
- A structured troubleshooting decision tree for any MAS issue

---

### Part 7: Troubleshooting in MAS vs Maximo 7.6: The Complete Comparison Guide

**[Read Part 7 →](/blog/troubleshooting-mas-vs-legacy)**

**Read time:** 22-28 minutes

The practical translation guide. Four real-world troubleshooting scenarios -- integration failures, performance degradation, SSO issues, and cron task failures -- each walked through step by step in both 7.6 and MAS, with side-by-side comparison tables. Includes the essential 10 `oc` commands every MAS admin must memorize and guidance on when to escalate to IBM Support.

**You will learn:**
- Side-by-side troubleshooting workflows for 7.6 vs. MAS
- The mental model shift from "control" to "observe and coordinate"
- The five most common mistakes new MAS admins make
- When and how to escalate to IBM Support for fastest resolution

## Key Themes Across the Series

**The role transforms, it does not disappear.** MAS changes what administrators do, not whether they are needed. The new role is different -- and in many ways more strategically important.

**The emotional journey is real.** Losing server access, giving up direct SQL, and shifting from infrastructure expert to platform operator triggers a genuine professional identity shift. Acknowledging this is the first step toward thriving in the new world.

**Skills transfer, tools do not.** Diagnostic thinking, performance intuition, security mindset, and Maximo domain expertise all transfer directly. The specific tools (WebSphere, EAR files, direct SQL) are replaced by new ones (OpenShift, operators, APIs).

**Collaboration replaces solo operation.** The legacy admin often worked alone. The MAS admin collaborates with platform teams, DBA teams, security teams, network teams, and IBM Support. Communication is the new superpower.

**The career trajectory is upward.** MAS admin skills -- cloud governance, identity management, API integration, observability -- are transferable across the enterprise cloud landscape. This is not a narrowing of career options but an expansion.
