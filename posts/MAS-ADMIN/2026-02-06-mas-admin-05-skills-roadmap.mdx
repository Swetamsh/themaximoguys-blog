faqs:
  - question: "Do SaaS admins need to learn Kubernetes?"
    answer: "Not in depth. SaaS admins should understand the concepts (pods, containers, operators) enough to read documentation and communicate with IBM support, but they do not need hands-on Kubernetes skills. Focus instead on IAM, API usage, integration troubleshooting, and MAS UI configuration."
  - question: "How long does it take to become competent in the new MAS admin skills?"
    answer: "For SaaS admins, 3-6 months of structured learning covers the essential skills. For on-prem admins who need Kubernetes and OpenShift skills, plan for 6-12 months of combined training and hands-on practice. The timeline depends heavily on prior Linux and infrastructure experience."
  - question: "Are there free resources for learning these skills?"
    answer: "Yes. Kubernetes has excellent free documentation and interactive tutorials (kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials). Red Hat offers free courses through Red Hat Academy and developer programs. IBM provides free MAS documentation and some training through IBM Training. Prometheus, Grafana, and Helm all have comprehensive free documentation."

keyTakeaways:
  - "SaaS admins need IAM, API, integration troubleshooting, and MAS UI configuration skills as their core competencies"
  - "On-prem admins need everything SaaS admins need PLUS Kubernetes, OpenShift, operators, storage, networking, and monitoring"
  - "A structured 12-month learning path with monthly milestones is the most effective approach"
  - "Certifications like CKA, Red Hat OpenShift Administration, and IBM MAS Administration validate skills and accelerate careers"
  - "Hands-on labs and sandbox environments are essential -- reading documentation alone is not sufficient"

# Skills MAS SysAdmins Must Learn

> **Who this is for:** Maximo administrators at any level who need a concrete learning plan for the MAS transition. Whether you are targeting a SaaS deployment or an on-prem OpenShift environment, this post gives you the roadmap.

**Read time:** 16 minutes

---

We have talked about how the sysadmin role changes in both SaaS and on-prem MAS deployments. Now comes the practical question: what exactly do you need to learn, and in what order?

In our experience, the administrators who struggle most during MAS transitions are not the ones who lack intelligence or motivation. They are the ones who try to learn everything at once, or who learn the wrong things first. A facilities admin spending three weeks on Kubernetes networking when their organization is deploying MAS SaaS is wasting precious time. An on-prem admin who skips Linux fundamentals to jump straight into OpenShift operator development is building on sand.

This post provides a structured, prioritized learning path. We have organized skills by deployment model (SaaS vs on-prem), priority level (critical vs important vs nice-to-have), and timeline (what to learn first, second, third).

---

## The Two Skill Tracks

MAS administration splits into two tracks based on your deployment model. The SaaS track is a subset of the on-prem track -- everything a SaaS admin needs, an on-prem admin also needs, plus substantially more.

### SaaS Admin Core Skills

These are the foundational skills every MAS SaaS administrator must develop:

1. **IAM and SSO (OAuth2, OIDC)** -- Identity and access management
2. **API Usage Basics** -- REST API interaction and testing
3. **Integration Troubleshooting** -- Diagnosing data flow issues
4. **MAS UI Configuration** -- System administration through the MAS interface
5. **Automation Scripting Basics** -- Python/Jython automation scripts
6. **Upgrade Testing** -- Validating SaaS updates in sandbox environments
7. **AppPoints Licensing** -- Understanding and optimizing license consumption
8. **Data Governance** -- Data quality, retention, and compliance

### On-Prem Admin Skills (SaaS Skills Plus)

On-prem admins need all of the above, plus:

9. **Kubernetes Fundamentals** -- Core container orchestration concepts
10. **OpenShift Administration** -- Red Hat's enterprise Kubernetes platform
11. **Operator Concepts** -- Operator Lifecycle Manager, Custom Resources
12. **Linux Administration** -- RHEL/CoreOS command-line proficiency
13. **Container Fundamentals** -- Docker/Podman, images, registries
14. **Storage Classes and Persistent Volumes** -- Kubernetes storage management
15. **Network Routing and Ingress** -- Service discovery, routes, load balancing
16. **API Gateways** -- External API exposure and rate limiting
17. **Monitoring Tools (Grafana, Prometheus)** -- Observability stack
18. **CI/CD Pipelines** -- Automated testing and deployment
19. **YAML, Helm, and Terraform** -- Infrastructure-as-code tooling

---

## Skill Priority Matrix

## How Each Skill Is Applied: Real-World Examples

Abstract skills become meaningful when you see how they are used in practice. Here are scenarios that connect skills to real MAS admin work.

### IAM/SSO in Practice

**Scenario:** A new acquisition joins the company. Their 500 field technicians need MAS access through the parent company's Azure AD. You configure OIDC federation between Azure AD and MAS, map Azure AD security groups to MAS security groups, and set up just-in-time user provisioning so accounts are created on first login. Without IAM/SSO skills, this is a support ticket to IBM. With them, it is a Tuesday afternoon task.

### Kubernetes in Practice

**Scenario:** Monday morning, 200 technicians report that the mobile app is slow. You check pod metrics and discover that the Manage API pods are at 95% memory utilization with frequent garbage collection pauses. You increase the memory limit in the ManageApp Custom Resource, the operator rolls out new pods with the higher limit, and performance returns to normal -- all without a restart or outage.

```yaml
# Before: insufficient memory
spec:
  settings:
    deployment:
      serverBundles:
        all:
          replica: 3
          resources:
            limits:
              memory: 4Gi
# After: increased memory limit
spec:
  settings:
    deployment:
      serverBundles:
        all:
          replica: 3
          resources:
            limits:
              memory: 6Gi
```

### Monitoring in Practice

**Scenario:** You set up a Prometheus alert that fires when the certificate for the MAS external route expires within 14 days. At 3 AM on a Saturday, the alert triggers. Instead of discovering an outage Monday morning when nobody can log in, the on-call engineer renews the certificate and avoids any user impact. That alert took 20 minutes to configure. It saved 4 hours of outage and an emergency change request.

### Integration Troubleshooting in Practice

**Scenario:** Work orders created in SAP are not appearing in MAS. You trace the integration flow: SAP sends a message to the integration bus, the bus routes to the MAS API. Using the integration log viewer, you discover that SAP changed a field format in their latest update, causing JSON parsing failures. You identify the specific field, work with the SAP team to align formats, reprocess the failed messages, and close the incident -- all without involving IBM support.

> **Key insight:** Every skill on this list maps to a real problem you will face in production. The question is not "will I use this?" but "when will I need this, and will I be ready?"

---

## Building a Team Learning Plan

If you are a manager building a team for MAS administration, here is how to structure the skill development across your team.

### SaaS Team (3-4 people)

| Role | Primary Focus | Secondary Focus |
|---|---|---|
| Lead Admin | IAM/SSO, MAS UI, upgrade testing | Integration troubleshooting, API |
| Integration Specialist | Integration troubleshooting, API usage | Automation scripting, data governance |
| Automation Developer | Automation scripting, API usage | MAS UI configuration, testing |

### On-Prem Team (5-7 people)

| Role | Primary Focus | Secondary Focus |
|---|---|---|
| MAS Platform Lead | Operators, MAS CR management, upgrades | Monitoring, capacity planning |
| OpenShift Admin | Cluster management, networking, storage | Monitoring, CI/CD |
| Monitoring Engineer | Prometheus, Grafana, log aggregation | OpenShift, alerting |
| Integration Specialist | API management, App Connect, Kafka | Troubleshooting, automation |
| Security Specialist | IAM/SSO, certificates, RBAC | Network policies, secrets management |

Cross-train at least two people on every critical skill. Single points of failure in knowledge are as dangerous as single points of failure in infrastructure.

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Prioritize ruthlessly.** Learn critical skills first (IAM, Kubernetes, operators). Nice-to-have skills can wait.

2. **Match your learning to your deployment model.** SaaS admins do not need deep Kubernetes skills. On-prem admins cannot skip them.

3. **Hands-on practice is non-negotiable.** Set up lab environments, break things deliberately, and learn to fix them.

4. **Certifications provide structure.** Use certification study paths as learning guides even if you do not take the exam.

5. **Build team capability, not individual heroes.** Cross-train across critical skills to eliminate knowledge bottlenecks.
