faqs:
  - question: "Can SaaS admins still troubleshoot technical issues, or do they just submit tickets to IBM?"
    answer: "SaaS admins have substantial troubleshooting capability through the MAS admin UI, API health checks, integration logs, and user-facing diagnostics. You no longer troubleshoot infrastructure, but application-layer, configuration, and integration issues are firmly in your domain. IBM Support is a partner for platform-level issues, not a replacement for your expertise."
  - question: "Will I be less valuable as an admin if my organization moves to MAS SaaS?"
    answer: "No — in our experience, the opposite is true. SaaS admins who understand governance, security, integration architecture, and upgrade coordination become more strategically valuable because they work at a higher level of abstraction. The role shifts from infrastructure specialist to business-technology bridge."
  - question: "How do upgrades work in MAS SaaS? Do I have any control?"
    answer: "IBM manages the upgrade schedule and execution. You participate by reviewing release notes, testing in lower environments when available, coordinating with your user community, and validating functionality after upgrades. You don't control timing, but you do control preparation and validation."

keyTakeaways:
  - "MAS SaaS is the biggest mindset shift for legacy admins — you move from infrastructure operator to functional, security, and governance owner"
  - "The grief of losing server access is real and valid, but it clears space for higher-value work"
  - "SaaS admins own users and roles, SSO/IAM configuration, integration credentials, upgrade coordination, AppPoints governance, and data quality"
  - "IBM Support becomes a partnership, not a last resort — learn the collaboration patterns early"
  - "The SaaS admin role is a career evolution, not a downgrade — it positions you as a strategic asset"

# How the SysAdmin Role Changes in MAS SaaS: From Server Room to Strategy Room

> **Who this is for:** Maximo administrators whose organizations are moving to MAS SaaS (IBM Cloud-hosted), admins currently operating MAS SaaS environments, and IT leaders evaluating the staffing impact of a SaaS migration.

**Estimated read time: 24 minutes**

---

## The Moment It Gets Real

You've read the migration plan. You've attended the architecture workshops. You've nodded along as the project team explained "cloud-native" and "operator-managed" and "shared responsibility model."

Then one day, someone asks you to troubleshoot a production issue, and you realize: you cannot SSH into anything. There is no server. There is no database console. There is no SystemOut.log to tail. There are no JVM arguments to adjust.

You open the MAS Suite Administration dashboard. You look at health indicators. You check the API endpoints. And a quiet voice in the back of your head says: *"This isn't my Maximo anymore."*

We've seen this moment many times. It is the point where the intellectual understanding of SaaS meets the emotional reality of giving up control. And it is the most important moment in the transition — because how you respond to it determines whether MAS SaaS becomes a source of frustration or a catalyst for career growth.

---

## The Five Stages of Losing Server Access

We're not being flippant when we compare this to grief stages. In our experience working with admin teams through SaaS migrations, the emotional progression is remarkably consistent:

### Stage 1: Denial

*"We'll still have some kind of server access. There must be a back door for emergencies. IBM will give us read-only SSH for troubleshooting."*

The reality: there is no server access in MAS SaaS. Not read-only. Not for emergencies. Not for "just this once." IBM manages the infrastructure, and that boundary is absolute.

### Stage 2: Anger

*"How am I supposed to do my job without database access? This is ridiculous. I can't diagnose anything from a dashboard. They're taking away our ability to fix problems."*

The anger is understandable. You've spent years building expertise that depended on direct access to systems. Having that access removed feels like having your tools confiscated.

### Stage 3: Bargaining

*"Maybe we should do on-prem instead of SaaS. Or hybrid. At least with on-prem I can still access the cluster. Can we get a special agreement with IBM for database access?"*

This stage often manifests as architectural pushback in migration planning meetings. Sometimes it's legitimate — some organizations genuinely need on-prem for compliance reasons. But often, it's the admin bargaining for familiar ground.

### Stage 4: Depression

*"I don't know what I'm supposed to do anymore. My skills don't matter. I'm just a ticket submitter now. My role has been reduced to clicking buttons in a web UI."*

This is where many admins get stuck. The narrative of "I'm just a ticket submitter" is seductive because it's simple. But it's wrong, and admins who stay here miss the opportunity that Stage 5 offers.

### Stage 5: Acceptance (and Evolution)

*"My job has changed. Some of what I did is now IBM's responsibility, and honestly, they're better equipped for it. My job now is to make sure MAS delivers value for our organization — and that requires a different kind of expertise."*

This is where the real transition happens. Not just accepting the change, but recognizing that the new role is substantively different and, in many ways, more strategically important.

> **Key insight:** If you're reading this and you're somewhere in stages 1 through 4, that's normal. It doesn't mean you're not adaptable or that you're "behind." It means you're processing a significant professional change. Give yourself permission to be uncomfortable with it while still moving forward.

## What SaaS Admins No Longer Do: The Complete List

Let's be thorough and honest about what's gone. No ambiguity, no hedging:

| Eliminated Responsibility | Why It's Gone | Who Does It Now |
|--------------------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Server access (SSH, RDP) | Infrastructure is IBM-managed | IBM Cloud Operations |
| Database access (SQL console) | Data layer is IBM-managed | IBM (data ops via API only) |
| WebSphere configuration | No WebSphere in MAS | N/A — replaced by operators |
| OS-level changes | No OS access | IBM Cloud Operations |
| JVM tuning | No direct JVM access | Operators manage pod resources |
| EAR deployment | No EAR files | Operators deploy containers |
| Backend log files | No filesystem access | Centralized logging via IBM |
| Custom SQL scripts | No database access | REST/GraphQL APIs |
| Pod restarts | No cluster access | IBM Cloud Operations |
| Direct fix pack application | No deployment access | IBM-managed continuous updates |
| SSL certificate management | No infrastructure access | IBM and cert-manager |
| Backup and restore execution | No storage access | IBM (SLA-backed) |
| Network configuration | No network access | IBM Cloud Operations |
| Performance tuning (infrastructure) | No infrastructure access | IBM capacity management |

This is a substantial list. It represents perhaps 60-70% of what a legacy admin's day looked like. The natural question is: what fills the remaining time?

The answer: higher-value work that was always important but often crowded out by infrastructure firefighting.

---

## What SaaS Admins Do Now: The Complete Picture

### User and Role Management

This responsibility existed in the legacy world but was often secondary to infrastructure work. In SaaS, it becomes a primary focus:

**User Lifecycle Management:**
- Provisioning new users through the identity provider and MAS Suite Administration
- Assigning application entitlements (which MAS applications each user can access)
- Managing user types (Premium, Limited, Base) for AppPoints optimization
- Deprovisioning users when they leave or change roles
- Auditing user access periodically for compliance

**Security Group Configuration:**
- Designing and maintaining Maximo security group structures
- Configuring application-level permissions (read, insert, save, delete per application)
- Implementing data restrictions using conditional expressions
- Managing site-level and organization-level access controls
- Testing security configurations to verify least-privilege principles

```
Example: Security group audit checklist (quarterly)

For each security group:
- [ ] Review membership — are all assigned users still in roles that require this access?
- [ ] Review permissions — are application permissions still appropriate?
- [ ] Review data restrictions — are conditional expressions still valid?
- [ ] Review GL account restrictions — are financial controls current?
- [ ] Document any changes and justification
```

### SSO and Identity Management

In MAS SaaS, the admin manages the connection between the organization's identity provider and MAS:

**Federation Configuration:**
- Setting up OIDC federation between MAS (Keycloak) and your enterprise IdP (Azure AD, Okta, Ping, etc.)
- Mapping IdP groups to MAS application entitlements
- Configuring multi-factor authentication policies
- Managing session timeout and token lifetime settings
- Troubleshooting authentication failures

**Practical Example: Troubleshooting a Login Failure**

When a user reports "I can't log in to MAS," the SaaS admin's diagnostic path looks like this:

1. **Verify the user exists in the identity provider** — Can they log in to other SSO-connected applications?
2. **Check MAS application entitlement** — Is the user assigned to the correct MAS workspace and applications?
3. **Review Maximo user record** — Does a corresponding Maximo person/user record exist and is it active?
4. **Check security group assignment** — Is the user in at least one security group with application access?
5. **Examine the error** — Is it an authentication error (IdP level) or an authorization error (MAS level)?
6. **If IdP level** — Work with your identity team or IBM Support
7. **If MAS level** — Resolve through MAS Suite Administration

This diagnostic process is entirely different from the legacy approach (check LDAP binding, verify WebSphere security realm, check WAS logs), but it requires the same systematic thinking.

> **Key insight:** SSO troubleshooting in MAS SaaS is actually more structured than legacy LDAP troubleshooting. The authentication chain has clear handoff points between systems. When something fails, the error typically indicates which handoff failed. This is an improvement over the "check everything in WebSphere" approach, even if it doesn't feel that way initially.

### Health Dashboards and Monitoring

SaaS admins don't manage infrastructure, but they absolutely monitor application health:

**MAS Suite Administration Dashboard:**
- System-wide health indicators
- Application activation status
- User count and licensing metrics
- Recent events and notifications

**Application-Level Monitoring:**
- CRON task execution status and history
- Integration queue depths and processing times
- Error rates and patterns
- User login patterns and failures

**API-Based Health Checks:**

```bash
# Check Manage application health
curl -s "https://manage.mas-{instance}.masdev.suite.maximo.com/maximo/oslc/apihealth" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}" | jq .

# Monitor integration queue status
curl -s "https://manage.mas-{instance}.masdev.suite.maximo.com/maximo/oslc/os/mxifacequeue?\
oslc.select=queuename,messagecount,errcount\
&oslc.where=errcount>0" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}" | jq '.member[]'
```

Even without infrastructure access, a SaaS admin can build comprehensive monitoring:

- **Scheduled API health checks** (run from your corporate network or a monitoring service)
- **Integration error alerting** (monitor queue error counts, trigger alerts when thresholds are exceeded)
- **User activity dashboards** (track login patterns, identify adoption issues)
- **AppPoints consumption tracking** (monitor against allocation, forecast overages)

### Integration Management

Integrations are often the most technically demanding aspect of the SaaS admin role:

**Integration Service Configuration:**
- Managing API credentials and endpoints for external system connections
- Configuring inbound and outbound integration channels
- Monitoring integration message processing and error rates
- Coordinating with external system teams on interface changes

**MIF Support in SaaS:**
MIF (Maximo Integration Framework) still exists within Manage in SaaS. The admin's role includes:
- Configuring object structures, publish channels, and enterprise services
- Managing integration endpoints (HTTP-based, not file-based)
- Monitoring queue processing and handling errors
- Coordinating with IBM Support for integration-related platform issues

**API Credential Management:**

```bash
# Example: Testing an outbound integration endpoint
curl -s -X POST \
  "https://manage.mas-{instance}.masdev.suite.maximo.com/maximo/oslc/os/mxwo" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "wonum": "TEST-API-001",
    "description": "API connectivity test - safe to delete",
    "siteid": "BEDFORD",
    "wopriority": 3
  }'

# Verify the test record was created
curl -s "https://manage.mas-{instance}.masdev.suite.maximo.com/maximo/oslc/os/mxwo?\
oslc.where=wonum=%22TEST-API-001%22" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}" | jq '.member[0]'
```

### Upgrade Coordination

MAS SaaS upgrades are managed by IBM, but the admin plays a critical coordination role:

**Before the Upgrade:**
1. Review IBM's release notes and known issues
2. Identify features or changes that affect your configuration
3. Communicate upcoming changes to your user community
4. Prepare test plans for critical business processes
5. Ensure lower environments (if available) are tested first

**During the Upgrade:**
1. Monitor IBM's upgrade communication
2. Be available for immediate post-upgrade validation
3. Track any user-reported issues

**After the Upgrade:**
1. Execute your test plan — verify critical workflows
2. Check integration health — are all interfaces processing correctly?
3. Validate security — can users access what they should (and only what they should)?
4. Review CRON task schedules — have any defaults changed?
5. Document any behavioral changes for your team
6. Report issues to IBM Support with clear reproduction steps

```
Example: Post-upgrade validation checklist

Core Workflow Tests:
- [ ] Create a work order from Start Center
- [ ] Approve a work order through workflow
- [ ] Complete and close a work order
- [ ] Generate a PM work order (PMWOGEN)
- [ ] Process a purchase requisition to PO

Integration Tests:
- [ ] Inbound work order creation from ERP
- [ ] Outbound asset data to data warehouse
- [ ] SSO login flow (full redirect cycle)
- [ ] API token generation (client credentials)

Security Tests:
- [ ] Admin user — verify full access
- [ ] Standard user — verify appropriate access
- [ ] Read-only user — verify restrictions apply
- [ ] External user — verify limited access
```

### AppPoints Governance

AppPoints management is an ongoing responsibility unique to MAS:

- **Monthly consumption reviews** — Are you within your licensed allocation?
- **User type optimization** — Are users assigned to the correct tier?
- **Application adoption tracking** — Which applications are being used, and which are consuming AppPoints without delivering value?
- **Forecasting** — Will planned user onboarding or new application activation exceed your allocation?
- **Reporting** — Providing license compliance data for audits and management reviews

### Data Governance

Without direct database access, data governance becomes more deliberate and API-driven:

- **Data quality monitoring** — Using reports and API queries to identify data issues
- **Data migration coordination** — Working with IBM and system integrators on data loads
- **Archive and retention** — Configuring data archival policies within the application
- **Compliance** — Ensuring data handling meets regulatory requirements (GDPR, industry-specific regulations)

---

## A Day in the Life: The MAS SaaS Admin

Here is what an actual Tuesday looks like for an experienced MAS SaaS admin:

**7:30 AM — Morning Health Check**
Open MAS Suite Administration dashboard. All systems green. Check overnight CRON task execution — PMWOGEN ran successfully, generated 47 work orders. Review integration queue — 3 error messages in the inbound queue from the ERP integration. Note these for investigation.

**8:00 AM — Integration Error Investigation**
Pull the error details from the integration queue through the Manage UI. The errors are malformed XML from the ERP system — a field that should be numeric contains a letter. Forward error details to the ERP team with a request to fix the source data and resubmit. This isn't a Maximo issue; it's a data quality issue in the source system.

**8:30 AM — User Access Request**
A new maintenance planner needs access to Manage. Create the user in the identity provider (or coordinate with the identity team). Assign MAS application entitlement. Create the Maximo person and user records. Assign to the "Planner" security group. Verify the user can log in and see the correct Start Center. Send welcome email with login instructions and support contact information.

**9:30 AM — Upgrade Planning Meeting**
IBM has announced a Manage update scheduled for next week. Review the release notes with the project team. Identify two changes that could affect customizations: a modified API response format and a new default CRON task schedule. Assign testing tasks to the functional team. Update the post-upgrade validation checklist.

**10:30 AM — AppPoints Review**
Monthly AppPoints report is due to management. Export consumption data from the MAS admin dashboard. Identify 12 users who haven't logged in for 60+ days. Recommend deactivating 8 of them (the other 4 are on extended leave). This would free up approximately 120 AppPoints that could be used for the Monitor pilot planned next quarter.

**11:30 AM — Security Audit Preparation**
The annual SOX audit requires evidence that user access is appropriate. Generate the current security group membership report. Cross-reference with HR's active employee list. Flag 3 users whose roles changed in the last quarter — verify their security group assignments still match their current job functions.

**1:00 PM — Support Case Follow-Up**
Check the status of an open IBM Support case regarding intermittent slow API responses. IBM has identified a connection pooling issue on their side and is applying a fix. They request that you monitor API response times for the next 48 hours and report any recurrence. Set up a simple curl-based monitoring script.

**2:00 PM — Integration Enhancement**
The maintenance team wants to add a new field to the work order integration with the ERP system. Review the object structure configuration. Add the field mapping. Test in the development environment. Document the change for the change advisory board. Schedule production implementation for the next approved change window.

**3:30 PM — Training Development**
Three new admins are joining the team next month. Begin documenting the SaaS admin runbook — daily health checks, common troubleshooting procedures, escalation paths, and IBM Support engagement guidelines. This documentation didn't exist because the legacy admin carried it all in their head.

**4:30 PM — End-of-Day Verification**
Quick health check. All integration queues processing normally. No new errors. CRON tasks running on schedule. AppPoints consumption within expected range. Log off.

Notice what's missing from this day: no server restarts, no JVM tuning, no EAR deployments, no database maintenance, no SSL certificate scrambles. But the day was full — with work that directly impacts the organization's ability to use Maximo effectively.

---

## IBM Support Collaboration: A New Partnership Model

In the legacy world, you called IBM Support when something was deeply broken and your own troubleshooting had been exhausted. In MAS SaaS, the relationship is fundamentally different.

### When to Engage IBM Support

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Platform health issue (dashboard shows problems) | Open a support case immediately |
| API errors that aren't configuration-related | Open a support case with error details |
| Performance degradation you can't explain | Open a support case with timestamps and symptoms |
| Pre-upgrade questions | Open an advisory case |
| Feature request or enhancement | Submit through Ideas Portal |
| User/config issue you can diagnose | Resolve yourself — no need for IBM |

### How to Be an Effective SaaS Support Partner

We've seen a clear pattern: admins who work effectively with IBM Support resolve issues faster. Here's what works:

1. **Provide timestamps** — "The issue started at approximately 14:30 UTC on February 3rd" is vastly more helpful than "it happened recently"
2. **Include error details** — API response codes, error messages from the UI, integration queue error text
3. **Describe the impact** — "12 users are unable to create work orders" helps IBM prioritize
4. **Note what you've already checked** — "I've verified user access, security groups, and the API endpoint is responding for other operations"
5. **Be responsive** — When IBM asks for additional information, provide it quickly. Stale cases get deprioritized.
6. **Request root cause** — After resolution, ask what caused the issue and whether your configuration contributed. This builds your knowledge.

### Environment Management: Dev, Test, Prod

Many MAS SaaS contracts include multiple environments. The admin manages the promotion pipeline:

```
Development          Test/QA              Production
┌──────────┐      ┌──────────┐        ┌──────────┐
│ Config    │ ──── │ Config   │ ────── │ Config   │
│ changes   │ test │ review   │ approve│ deploy   │
│ here      │      │ here     │        │ here     │
└──────────┘      └──────────┘        └──────────┘

Security groups ─── Validate ─────────── Promote
Integrations ────── End-to-end test ──── Promote
CRON schedules ──── Verify timing ────── Promote
User configs ────── UAT ──────────────── Promote
```

> **Key insight:** Environment management in SaaS requires more discipline than on-prem because you can't simply "copy the database." Configuration promotion must be deliberate, documented, and tested at each stage. This discipline actually reduces the "it works in dev but not production" problems that plagued legacy environments.

---

## What I Lost vs. What I Gained: An Honest Assessment

### What I Lost

- **Direct control** — The ability to SSH in and fix something immediately
- **Diagnostic depth** — Thread dumps, heap analysis, database execution plans
- **Speed of emergency response** — Some fixes that took 5 minutes now require a support case
- **Autonomy** — The ability to make infrastructure changes without depending on anyone else
- **Familiar tools** — SQL Developer, WebSphere admin console, tail, grep
- **The identity of "the person who keeps Maximo running"**

These losses are real. Dismissing them does a disservice to the experience and expertise they represent.

### What I Gained

- **Freedom from 3 AM infrastructure calls** — IBM's operations team handles hardware failures, pod crashes, and platform issues. Your phone buzzes less at night.
- **Time for strategic work** — Without spending 60% of your day on infrastructure maintenance, you can focus on security governance, integration optimization, and user enablement.
- **Reduced risk exposure** — You're no longer the single point of failure for infrastructure. If you're on vacation, production doesn't depend on your SSH key.
- **Access to IBM's operational expertise** — IBM's cloud operations team manages thousands of MAS instances. They see patterns and solve problems faster than a single-organization admin could.
- **Automatic security patching** — No more emergency weekend patching for critical vulnerabilities. IBM handles this continuously.
- **Career positioning** — Cloud governance, IAM, API management, and data governance skills are in demand across all enterprise platforms, not just Maximo.
- **Professional development time** — Less firefighting means more time for learning, certification, and skill development.

### The Net Assessment

In our experience, the first six months feel like a net loss. The familiar power and autonomy of direct access is gone, and the new capabilities haven't fully developed yet. By month twelve, most admins report feeling at least equal to where they were. By month eighteen, the majority say they wouldn't go back.

The key variable is whether the admin actively invests in the new skill set or passively waits for the job to come to them.

---

## The Career Path: Evolution, Not Demotion

There is a persistent fear among legacy admins that MAS SaaS represents a demotion — from technical expert to "button clicker." Let's address this directly.

### The Old Career Ladder

```
Junior Maximo Admin
      ↓
Senior Maximo Admin (WebSphere, DB, LDAP mastery)
      ↓
Principal Maximo Admin / Technical Lead
      ↓
... limited growth without changing platforms
```

The legacy admin career often plateaued because the skill set was highly specialized. WebSphere expertise doesn't transfer to much outside the IBM ecosystem. Oracle DBA skills are valuable but separate from the Maximo domain.

### The New Career Ladder

```
MAS SaaS Admin (governance, security, integrations)
      ↓
Senior MAS Admin / MAS Platform Specialist
      ↓
Cloud Operations Lead / EAM Platform Manager
      ↓
IT Governance Manager / Enterprise Integration Architect
      ↓
... broader growth across cloud platforms and enterprise architecture
```

The MAS SaaS admin skill set — cloud governance, identity management, API integration, compliance monitoring — is transferable across cloud platforms. An admin who masters these skills in MAS can apply them to Salesforce, SAP S/4HANA Cloud, ServiceNow, or any other enterprise SaaS platform.

### Skills That Transfer Beyond Maximo

| MAS SaaS Skill | Transferable To |
|----------------|----------------|
| OIDC/OAuth2 IAM management | Any cloud platform SSO |
| API-based system monitoring | Any API-driven application |
| SaaS governance and compliance | Any enterprise SaaS platform |
| Integration architecture (REST/event-driven) | Any modern integration pattern |
| AppPoints / consumption-based licensing | Any usage-based cloud service |
| Change management and upgrade coordination | Universal project management |
| Vendor management (IBM Support partnership) | Any vendor relationship |

> **Key insight:** The most significant career benefit of MAS SaaS administration is portability. Legacy Maximo admin skills were deeply valuable but narrowly applicable. MAS SaaS admin skills are broadly applicable across the enterprise cloud landscape. This is not a demotion — it's a career expansion.

---

## From Implementation to Orchestration: The Mindset Framework

The single most useful mental model for SaaS admins is this: **you have moved from implementation to orchestration.**

### Implementation Mindset (Legacy)

- "I configure the server."
- "I deploy the code."
- "I fix the data."
- "I manage the infrastructure."
- "I am the person who makes Maximo work."

### Orchestration Mindset (SaaS)

- "I ensure the right people have the right access."
- "I coordinate integrations between Maximo and our enterprise systems."
- "I govern how the platform is used and ensure compliance."
- "I validate that IBM's platform delivers the performance and reliability we contracted for."
- "I am the person who ensures Maximo delivers business value."

The orchestration mindset doesn't mean you're less technical. It means your technical skills are applied at a different layer — the governance, security, and integration layer rather than the infrastructure layer.

## The Honest Truth

MAS SaaS administration is different from legacy Maximo administration. Not easier. Not harder. Different.

Some days you'll miss the server room. You'll miss the feeling of diagnosing a complex issue with nothing but SSH and SQL. You'll miss the authority that came with being the only person who could restart the application server at 3 AM.

But other days — the days when you're designing a security governance framework, or optimizing AppPoints allocation to save your organization six figures, or coordinating a seamless upgrade that doesn't interrupt a single user — you'll realize that the new role is what the old role was always evolving toward.

The infrastructure work was important. But it was also a ceiling. MAS SaaS removes that ceiling and replaces it with a view of the strategic landscape.

We've seen admins make this transition many times. The ones who succeed are the ones who grieve what they've lost, embrace what they've gained, and build deliberately toward what comes next.

---

## Key Takeaways

- **MAS SaaS is the most significant mindset shift** — from infrastructure owner to governance and orchestration owner
- **The emotional journey is real** — losing server access feels like losing professional identity, and acknowledging this is essential for moving forward
- **SaaS admins have substantial technical responsibilities** — users, security, integrations, monitoring, upgrades, licensing, and data governance fill the day
- **IBM Support is a partnership** — learn to work effectively with IBM early, because the collaboration model determines your incident response capability
- **The career trajectory is upward and outward** — SaaS admin skills are portable across cloud platforms, making you more valuable in the broader IT market
- **Give it 12-18 months** — the transition feels like a loss initially but becomes a gain as new capabilities develop
