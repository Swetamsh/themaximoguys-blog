faqs:
  - question: "What does AI-assisted troubleshooting look like for MAS administrators?"
    answer: "AI-assisted troubleshooting correlates logs, metrics, events, and known issue databases simultaneously -- something that would take a human admin hours of manual investigation. For example, an AI system can ingest 50,000 log lines, cross-reference them with recent deployment events, and within 60 seconds suggest 'Root cause: OAuth token refresh failure in Keycloak after certificate rotation at 02:15 UTC. Recommended action: Restart the Keycloak pod and verify certificate chain.' The admin validates and approves rather than discovering from scratch."
  - question: "What certifications should MAS admins pursue for the future?"
    answer: "We recommend a three-tier progression: Foundation tier -- Red Hat Certified System Administrator (RHCSA), Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD), IBM MAS Administrator certification. Growth tier -- Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA), AWS/Azure/GCP cloud certifications, HashiCorp Terraform Associate. Leadership tier -- Google SRE certification, TOGAF Foundation (architecture), ITIL 4 Managing Professional."
  - question: "How do self-healing operators work in MAS?"
    answer: "Self-healing operators continuously compare the desired state (defined in Custom Resources) with the actual state of the cluster. When drift is detected -- for example, a pod crash, certificate expiration, or resource exhaustion -- the operator automatically takes corrective action: restarting pods, rotating certificates, or scaling resources. This is the reconciliation loop pattern central to Kubernetes, and MAS operators like ibm-mas and ibm-mas-manage implement it for Maximo-specific components."

keyTakeaways:
  - "AI-assisted troubleshooting will reduce mean-time-to-resolution from hours to minutes by correlating logs, metrics, and known issues automatically"
  - "Self-healing operators already handle routine recovery in MAS today -- the future extends this to predictive prevention and autonomous remediation"
  - "The MAS admin career path leads naturally to Site Reliability Engineering (SRE), where Maximo domain expertise is a rare and valuable differentiator"
  - "Start preparing now: learn OpenShift deeply, practice oc commands daily, explore observability platforms, and invest in at least one cloud-native certification per year"
  - "The future MAS admin is not a button-clicking operator but a cloud-native reliability and governance leader who orchestrates AI, automation, and human judgment"

# The Future MAS SysAdmin: AI, Automation, and Autonomous Monitoring

**Series:** MAS ADMIN | **Part 8 of 8** (Series Finale)

**Read Time:** 20-24 minutes

---

> **Who this is for:** Current and aspiring Maximo administrators who want to understand where their role is heading over the next 3-7 years -- and how to position themselves at the forefront of that evolution rather than being left behind by it.

---

## Introduction: A Letter From 2030

Imagine receiving this morning briefing from your MAS environment in 2030:

```
DAILY OPERATIONS SUMMARY - February 6, 2030
Environment: MAS Production (East Region)

AUTONOMOUS ACTIONS TAKEN (Last 24 Hours):
  - 02:15 UTC: Certificate rotation completed for 14 services.
    Zero downtime. Next rotation scheduled: March 8, 2030.
  - 04:30 UTC: Memory pressure detected on manage-server-pod-07.
    Pod gracefully drained and rescheduled to node worker-12.
    User impact: None (request routing shifted in 1.2 seconds).
  - 11:45 UTC: Integration latency to ERP increased from 120ms to 890ms.
    Root cause identified: ERP connection pool saturation.
    Automated alert sent to ERP team. MAS-side retry policy adjusted
    from 3x to 5x with exponential backoff. Messages queued: 47.
    All 47 processed successfully after ERP team responded at 12:10 UTC.
  - 19:00 UTC: PMWoGenCronTask generated 234 preventive maintenance
    work orders. Anomaly detected: 12% increase over 30-day average.
    Analysis: seasonal equipment usage pattern. No action required.

ITEMS REQUIRING HUMAN REVIEW:
  - License utilization at 87%. Projected to reach 95% by April 2030.
    Recommendation: Initiate license expansion discussion with IBM.
  - New MAS 9.4.2 patch available. Release notes analyzed.
    Risk assessment: LOW. Recommended maintenance window: Feb 15-16.
    Detailed upgrade plan attached.

HEALTH SCORE: 98.7/100 (up from 98.2 yesterday)
```

This is not science fiction. Every capability described above either exists today in some form or is on a clear development trajectory. The question is not *whether* MAS administration will look like this -- it is *when*, and whether you will be the person reading that briefing or the person it replaced.

In this final installment of the MAS ADMIN series, we explore the forces shaping the future of Maximo administration and provide a concrete roadmap for the professionals who will lead it.

---

## Part 1: AI-Assisted Troubleshooting

### What It Looks Like Today

AI-assisted troubleshooting is not a future concept. Elements of it exist today, though they remain fragmented. The current state involves manual correlation -- an admin reads logs, checks metrics, cross-references with recent changes, and uses their experience to form hypotheses. The intelligence is in the admin's head.

The near-future state puts that correlation into software.

### A Concrete Scenario: AI-Assisted Root Cause Analysis

**The Problem:**
At 3:00 AM, MAS monitoring detects that work order creation response times have increased from 2 seconds to 18 seconds across all sites.

**Today's Workflow (Without AI):**

1. Admin receives alert (5 minutes to notice if sleeping)
2. Log into OpenShift console (3 minutes)
3. Check pod health -- all pods Running (5 minutes)
4. Check pod resource utilization -- CPU normal, memory elevated (5 minutes)
5. Stream logs from Manage pods -- no obvious errors (10 minutes)
6. Check database connection pool -- DSRA9400W warnings found (10 minutes)
7. Check recent events -- notice a Manage deployment occurred at 2:45 AM (5 minutes)
8. Check the deployment diff -- new resource limits reduced memory from 4Gi to 2Gi (10 minutes)
9. Revert the resource limit change (5 minutes)
10. Verify resolution (5 minutes)

**Total time: approximately 60 minutes.**

**Future Workflow (With AI Correlation):**

```
ALERT: Work order creation latency anomaly detected.
  Current: 18.2s (baseline: 2.1s, 8.7x deviation)

AI ANALYSIS (completed in 47 seconds):
  Correlated signals:
    1. Manage pod memory utilization: 1.95Gi / 2.0Gi (97.5%)
    2. DSRA9400W connection pool warnings: 147 in last 15 min
    3. GC pause frequency: 12x baseline
    4. Recent change: ManageWorkspace CR updated at 02:45 UTC
       - memory limit changed: 4Gi -> 2Gi
       - Change author: deploy-pipeline-sa (automated)

  ROOT CAUSE (confidence: 94%):
    Memory limit reduction in ManageWorkspace CR is causing
    GC pressure, which is exhausting the database connection pool,
    which is causing request queuing and elevated latency.

  RECOMMENDED ACTION:
    Revert memory limit to 4Gi in ManageWorkspace CR.
    Command: oc patch manageworkspace inst1-manage -n mas-inst1-manage
      --type merge -p '{"spec":{"settings":{"resources":
      {"limits":{"memory":"4Gi"}}}}}'

  ALTERNATIVE: Scale to 6 replicas at current 2Gi limit
    (addresses symptom, not root cause).

  Awaiting admin approval to execute recommended action.
```

**Total time: approximately 5 minutes** (47 seconds for AI analysis, 4 minutes for admin to review and approve).

> **Key insight:** The AI does not replace the admin. It replaces the tedious correlation work -- checking six different data sources, scrolling through thousands of log lines, and mentally linking cause to effect. The admin still makes the decision. But the admin makes the decision in 5 minutes instead of 60.

### RAG-Based Knowledge Assistants

One of the most promising near-term AI capabilities is the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) knowledge assistant. Imagine being able to ask, in natural language:

```
"Why is the PMWoGenCronTask failing with error BMXAA4188E
 and how do we fix it in MAS?"
```

And receiving a response that draws from:

- IBM's official MAS documentation
- Your organization's runbooks and post-incident reviews
- Historical support cases from your environment
- Community knowledge bases and forums
- Your environment's specific configuration and recent changes

This is not a generic chatbot. It is a knowledge system trained on your operational context. Several organizations we work with are already piloting RAG assistants for their Maximo operations teams, using IBM watsonx or similar platforms to index their internal documentation.

### The Three Stages of AI Troubleshooting

**Stage 1: Assisted (2025-2027)**
- AI suggests possible root causes from log analysis
- Admin investigates and validates each suggestion
- AI learns from admin's corrections
- Value: reduces investigation time by 40-60%

**Stage 2: Augmented (2027-2029)**
- AI correlates across all data sources automatically
- AI presents ranked hypotheses with confidence scores
- Admin approves or rejects recommended actions
- AI executes approved actions
- Value: reduces mean-time-to-resolution by 70-80%

**Stage 3: Autonomous (2029-2032)**
- AI detects, diagnoses, and remediates known issue patterns
- Admin is notified after the fact for known issues
- Admin is consulted in real-time only for novel issues
- AI generates and updates runbooks automatically
- Value: 90%+ of incidents resolved without human intervention

## Part 2: Self-Healing Operators and Autonomous Operations

### How Self-Healing Works Today

MAS already uses the Kubernetes operator pattern for self-healing. The concept is straightforward: an operator continuously compares the *desired state* (defined in a Custom Resource) with the *actual state* of the cluster. When they diverge, the operator takes action to reconcile.

**What MAS Operators Already Handle Autonomously:**

```
SELF-HEALING CAPABILITIES (Current MAS Operators):

ibm-mas operator:
  - Restarts failed Suite components
  - Maintains desired replica counts
  - Manages internal certificate lifecycle
  - Reconciles configuration drift

ibm-mas-manage operator:
  - Restarts crashed Manage pods
  - Maintains ServerBundle configurations
  - Applies database schema migrations
  - Manages deployment rollouts

ibm-sls operator:
  - Maintains license service availability
  - Rotates internal tokens
  - Monitors license file validity
```

This is already self-healing. If a Manage pod crashes, the operator recreates it. If a deployment drifts from the desired state, the operator reconciles. You do not restart Maximo manually in MAS -- the platform does it for you.

### Where Self-Healing Is Going

The current self-healing is *reactive* -- it responds to failures after they occur. The future is *predictive* and *preventive*.

**Predictive Self-Healing (2027-2029):**

```
PREDICTIVE SCENARIO:

Observation (Monday 09:00):
  Memory utilization trend: +2.3% per day for 14 days
  Current: 78% of limit
  Projected breach: Thursday 15:00

Autonomous Action (Monday 09:05):
  - Increased memory limit from 4Gi to 5Gi (within approved range)
  - Logged change to audit trail
  - Notified admin team via Slack

Result:
  Thursday 15:00 passes without incident.
  No page. No escalation. No downtime.
```

**Autonomous Upgrade Operations (2029-2032):**

```
AUTONOMOUS UPGRADE SCENARIO:

New patch detected: MAS 9.4.2
AI risk assessment: LOW (no schema changes, no API breaking changes)

Autonomous actions:
  1. Applied patch to staging environment (Tuesday 22:00)
  2. Ran automated test suite: 847/847 passed
  3. Monitored staging for 48 hours: no anomalies
  4. Scheduled production maintenance window: Saturday 02:00
  5. Applied patch to production with rolling deployment
  6. Monitored production for 4 hours: no anomalies
  7. Sent summary report to admin team

Human involvement: Read the summary report on Monday morning.
```

> **Key insight:** Self-healing operators are not replacing admins. They are eliminating the repetitive, predictable work that currently occupies 60-70% of an admin's time. This frees the admin to focus on architecture, governance, optimization, and strategy -- the work that actually requires human judgment.

---

## Part 3: AIOps for MAS Specifically

### What AIOps Means in the MAS Context

AIOps (Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations) is a broad term. For MAS administrators specifically, it means applying machine learning to four operational domains:

**Domain 1: Anomaly Detection**

Instead of setting static thresholds ("alert if CPU exceeds 80%"), AIOps learns the normal patterns of your MAS environment and alerts on *deviations from normal*.

```
TRADITIONAL ALERTING:
  Rule: Alert if manage-pod CPU > 80%
  Problem: CPU hits 85% every night during PM generation. This is normal.
  Result: Nightly false alarm. Admin learns to ignore alerts.

AIOPS ANOMALY DETECTION:
  Learned pattern: CPU rises to 82-88% nightly between 23:00-23:45
  Alert: CPU at 85% at 23:15 -- EXPECTED (no alert)
  Alert: CPU at 85% at 14:30 -- ANOMALOUS (investigate)
  Result: Only actionable alerts. Admin trusts the system.
```

**Domain 2: Log Clustering and Pattern Recognition**

MAS generates thousands of log lines per minute across dozens of pods. AIOps clusters these logs into meaningful patterns and highlights the ones that matter.

```
RAW LOG VOLUME (24 hours):
  manage-server pods: 2.4 million lines
  core pods: 890,000 lines
  operator logs: 120,000 lines

AIOPS CLUSTERING RESULT:
  Cluster 1: Normal request processing (99.2% of logs)
  Cluster 2: Routine health checks (0.6% of logs)
  Cluster 3: DSRA connection warnings -- NEW PATTERN (0.15% of logs)
    First appeared: 14:22 UTC
    Frequency: increasing (2/min -> 12/min over 3 hours)
    Recommendation: Investigate database connection pool sizing

  Admin reviews 1 cluster summary instead of 3.4 million log lines.
```

**Domain 3: Change Impact Analysis**

Every configuration change, deployment, or patch carries risk. AIOps analyzes historical change-incident correlations to predict risk before changes are applied.

```
PROPOSED CHANGE: Update ManageWorkspace CR to add new ServerBundle

AIOPS RISK ANALYSIS:
  Historical data: 47 similar changes in comparable environments
  Outcomes: 42 successful (89%), 3 minor issues (6%), 2 rollbacks (4%)
  Common failure mode: Insufficient cluster resources for new pods
  Your cluster headroom: 34% CPU, 28% memory -- ADEQUATE

  Risk score: LOW (92% confidence)
  Recommended: Proceed with standard change window
  Monitoring: Increase observation period to 2 hours post-change
```

**Domain 4: Capacity Planning and Forecasting**

AIOps tracks resource consumption trends and projects future needs, giving admins months of lead time instead of discovering capacity issues during outages.

```
CAPACITY FORECAST (Generated Monthly):

Current state (February 2030):
  Cluster CPU utilization: 62% (average), 84% (peak)
  Cluster memory utilization: 71% (average), 89% (peak)
  Storage utilization: 58%
  License utilization: 87%

Projected state (June 2030, based on growth trends):
  Cluster CPU: 74% avg, 96% peak -- ACTION NEEDED
  Cluster memory: 82% avg, 98% peak -- ACTION NEEDED
  Storage: 65% -- OK
  Licenses: 94% -- WATCH

Recommendation:
  Add 2 worker nodes by April 2030 to maintain 30% headroom.
  Initiate license expansion discussion by March 2030.
```

Key characteristics:
- Autonomous remediation for known patterns
- AIOps-driven anomaly detection
- Automated change risk analysis
- Self-service capacity management
- Admins as reliability architects

**2032: The Orchestration Year**

The admin role has fully evolved into a reliability leadership position. AI handles routine operations end-to-end. Humans define policies, review AI decisions, handle novel situations, and drive continuous improvement.

Key characteristics:
- AI-driven operations with human oversight
- Policy-based governance (humans define rules, AI enforces)
- Autonomous patching and upgrades for low-risk changes
- Admins as strategic advisors to business stakeholders
- Focus on optimization, compliance, and innovation

## Part 5: The SRE Career Path for Maximo Admins

### Why Maximo Admins Are Uniquely Positioned

Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) is the discipline that applies software engineering principles to operations problems. It is the natural evolution of the traditional sysadmin role -- and Maximo administrators are exceptionally well-positioned for it.

Here is why:

**You Understand the Application Deeply.** Most SRE candidates come from a pure infrastructure background. They know Kubernetes but they do not know what a PM frequency means, why a cron task matters, or how MIF message flow works. You do. That domain knowledge is rare and valuable.

**You Have Operational Instincts.** Years of 7.6 administration built your intuition for what "feels wrong" in a Maximo environment. That intuition does not disappear in MAS -- it becomes more valuable, because you can direct investigation efforts more efficiently than someone who has never administered Maximo.

**You Already Think in Systems.** Maximo 7.6 administration required understanding the interplay between the application server, the database, the integration framework, the security layer, and the business processes. That is systems thinking. MAS just adds more components to the system.

### The Career Evolution: From Admin to SRE

### Certifications Worth Pursuing

We recommend a phased approach to certification, building from your current foundation:

**Foundation Tier (Start Now):**

| Certification | Why It Matters | Estimated Study Time |
|--------------|----------------|---------------------|
| Red Hat Certified System Administrator (RHCSA) | Core Linux skills for OpenShift | 80-120 hours |
| Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD) | Validates your pod/container knowledge | 60-100 hours |
| IBM MAS Administrator | Formalizes your MAS expertise | 40-60 hours |

**Growth Tier (Year 1-2):**

| Certification | Why It Matters | Estimated Study Time |
|--------------|----------------|---------------------|
| Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) | Deep cluster administration skills | 80-120 hours |
| AWS Solutions Architect Associate (or Azure/GCP equivalent) | Cloud platform fundamentals | 100-150 hours |
| HashiCorp Terraform Associate | Infrastructure as Code proficiency | 40-60 hours |

**Leadership Tier (Year 2-4):**

| Certification | Why It Matters | Estimated Study Time |
|--------------|----------------|---------------------|
| Google Cloud Professional SRE | Industry-recognized SRE credential | 100-150 hours |
| TOGAF Foundation | Enterprise architecture thinking | 60-80 hours |
| ITIL 4 Managing Professional | Service management leadership | 80-120 hours |

> **Key insight:** You do not need all of these certifications. Pick one per year that aligns with your career direction. The CKAD or CKA alone will transform how you interact with MAS. The SRE certification will open doors to roles that most Maximo admins do not even know exist.

---

## Part 6: How to Start Preparing Today

You do not need to wait for 2030 to begin this evolution. Here are concrete actions you can take this month.

### Action 1: Master the oc CLI

Stop using the OpenShift web console as your primary interface. Force yourself to use `oc` for everything for 30 days. The muscle memory you build will pay dividends for the rest of your career.

```bash
# Daily practice routine (15 minutes)

# Morning: Check your environment health
oc get pods -n mas-inst1-manage
oc get pods -n mas-inst1-core
oc adm top pods -n mas-inst1-manage
oc get events -n mas-inst1-manage --sort-by='.lastTimestamp' | head -20

# Midday: Read some logs
oc logs $(oc get pods -n mas-inst1-manage -l app.kubernetes.io/component=manage-server \
  -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') -n mas-inst1-manage --tail=100

# End of day: Review resource trends
oc adm top nodes
oc get pods -n mas-inst1-manage -o custom-columns=\
  NAME:.metadata.name,RESTARTS:.status.containerStatuses[0].restartCount
```

### Action 2: Set Up Proper Monitoring

If your MAS environment only has default monitoring, you are flying blind. Invest time in setting up meaningful dashboards.

**Minimum Viable Monitoring for MAS:**

- Pod health across all MAS namespaces (running, restarting, failing)
- Response time percentiles for the Manage application (p50, p95, p99)
- Integration message success/failure rates
- Cron task execution success rates
- Certificate expiration dates (alert 30 days before expiry)
- Resource utilization trends (CPU, memory, storage)

### Action 3: Build a Personal Runbook

Document every troubleshooting scenario you encounter. For each one, record:

1. The symptom (what did the user report?)
2. The diagnostic steps you took
3. The root cause
4. The resolution
5. How you would detect this proactively next time

After six months, you will have an invaluable knowledge base -- and the raw material for training an AI assistant on your environment.

### Action 4: Learn One Automation Tool

Pick one and go deep:

- **Ansible:** Excellent for MAS deployment automation and configuration management. IBM provides Ansible collections for MAS.
- **Bash scripting:** Automate your daily health checks, evidence collection, and reporting.
- **Python:** Build custom monitoring integrations, log analysis scripts, and API automation.

Start with the tool that addresses your biggest daily pain point. If you spend 30 minutes every morning checking pod health across namespaces, automate that first.

### Action 5: Join the Community

The MAS admin community is small but growing. Connect with peers who are navigating the same transition:

- IBM TechXchange Community (formerly IBM Community)
- Maximo User Groups (regional and virtual)
- OpenShift and Kubernetes meetups
- LinkedIn groups focused on Maximo and EAM

The administrators who thrive in the future will be those who learn from each other, not just from documentation.

---

## Part 7: The Future Admin Identity

Let us name what the MAS administrator is becoming. This is not a diminishment of the role -- it is an elevation.

**The Traditional Maximo Admin Was:**
- A server operator
- A database administrator
- A configuration specialist
- A restart-and-patch technician
- Defined by access to infrastructure

**The Future MAS Admin Is:**
- An orchestrator of automated systems
- An observer who reads signals across distributed components
- A reliability specialist who defines and measures service levels
- A governance owner who ensures compliance and security
- An architecture-informed operator who understands why the system is designed the way it is

The shift is from *doing the work* to *ensuring the work gets done*. The operator pattern in Kubernetes is a microcosm of this: the operator does the work (restarting pods, reconciling state), while the admin defines the desired state and monitors the outcomes.

This is not a lesser role. It is a more strategic one. The admin who can articulate "Our MAS environment maintains 99.95% availability across 12,000 users with a mean-time-to-resolution of 8 minutes for P1 incidents" is far more valuable to the organization than the admin who can say "I restarted the JVM three times last Tuesday."

---

## Series Conclusion: The Journey From 7.6 to Whatever Comes Next

This is the final installment of the MAS ADMIN series. Over eight parts, we have walked through a transformation that is reshaping the career of every Maximo administrator on the planet.

**Where We Started (Part 1):**
We acknowledged the identity crisis. The tools you mastered over years of 7.6 administration -- SSH, direct database access, WebSphere administration, filesystem logs -- are gone. The transition to MAS is not just a technology change. It is a professional identity change.

**What We Covered (Parts 2-6):**
We built the practical knowledge base for the modern MAS admin. OpenShift fundamentals. Pod lifecycle management. Monitoring and observability. Security in a cloud-native world. Backup, recovery, and disaster planning. Each topic translated 7.6 instincts into MAS-native workflows.

**What We Compared (Part 7):**
We put the old and new worlds side by side. Four troubleshooting scenarios, each showing the 7.6 workflow and the MAS workflow in detail. The diagnostic thinking is the same. The tools are different. And the evidence-collection discipline is more important than ever.

**Where We Are Going (Part 8, This Post):**
We looked forward. AI-assisted troubleshooting, self-healing operators, AIOps, autonomous operations. The admin role is evolving from hands-on operator to reliability leader. The skills that matter are shifting from server management to systems thinking, from manual intervention to automation design, from individual heroics to collaborative orchestration.

### The One Thing We Want You to Remember

If you take away only one idea from this entire series, let it be this:

**Your Maximo expertise is not obsolete. It is the foundation for something more powerful.**

Every year of experience you have with Maximo -- understanding how PM generation works, how integration frameworks flow, how security groups interact, how escalations fire, how cron tasks behave -- is knowledge that no Kubernetes certification can teach. It is domain expertise. And in a world where the infrastructure is increasingly automated, domain expertise is the differentiator.

The administrators who thrive in the MAS era will be those who combine their deep Maximo knowledge with new cloud-native skills. Not one or the other. Both.

The platform will keep changing. MAS 9 will become MAS 10. OpenShift will evolve. AI capabilities will expand. But the need for someone who understands what the system should be doing, who can recognize when something is wrong, who can make judgment calls about risk and priority -- that need is permanent.

You are that person. The tools are changing. The mission is the same.

Welcome to the future of Maximo administration. We will see you there.

## Key Takeaways

1. **AI-assisted troubleshooting is not a distant future.** Elements exist today, and by 2027 most MAS environments will use AI for log correlation and root cause suggestion. Your role shifts from manual investigation to reviewing AI-generated hypotheses.

2. **Self-healing operators are already working for you.** MAS operators handle pod restarts, configuration reconciliation, and state management today. The future extends this to predictive prevention and autonomous remediation of known patterns.

3. **The SRE career path is natural for Maximo admins.** Your domain expertise is rare. Combine it with cloud-native certifications (CKAD, CKA) and observability skills, and you become uniquely valuable -- someone who understands both the platform and the application.

4. **Start preparing now, not later.** Master the `oc` CLI. Set up proper monitoring. Build runbooks. Learn one automation tool. Pursue one certification this year. Small, consistent investments compound over time.

5. **The future admin is a reliability leader, not a button-clicking operator.** You will define SLOs, manage error budgets, design monitoring strategies, govern AI-driven automation, and communicate operational risk to executives. This is an elevation of the role, not a diminishment.
