faqs:
  - question: "Is MAS 9 compatible with on-premise deployments?"
    answer: "MAS 9 is cloud-native and requires OpenShift or compatible Kubernetes. However, you can deploy it in your own data center using Red Hat OpenShift."
  - question: "What's the upgrade path from Maximo 7.6?"
    answer: "Direct upgrade isn't supported. You'll need to migrate to MAS 8.x first, then upgrade to MAS 9. Migration tools are available to help with data transfer."
  - question: "Does MAS 9 require Cloud Pak for Data?"
    answer: "Cloud Pak for Data is optional for base functionality but required if you want to use AI features like Predict and Monitor."

keyTakeaways:
  - "MAS 9 introduces unified AppPoints licensing model"
  - "New React-based UI framework for improved performance"
  - "Enhanced AI capabilities with tighter Watson integration"
  - "Breaking changes require testing before production upgrade"
  - "Migration from MAS 8 typically takes 2-4 weeks"

## Executive Summary

IBM Maximo Application Suite 9 (MAS 9) represents a significant evolution in enterprise asset management. Released in Q4 2025, MAS 9 focuses on AI integration, user experience improvements, and cloud-native architecture enhancements.

<AnswerBox question="Should I upgrade to MAS 9?">
  If you're on MAS 8.x with active maintenance, yes—but plan for 2-4 weeks of testing. The new UI and AI features provide significant value. If you're on Maximo 7.6 or earlier, migrate to MAS 8 first.
</AnswerBox>

**Who should upgrade immediately?**
- Organizations investing in predictive maintenance
- Companies with large mobile workforces
- Enterprises requiring advanced integration capabilities

**Who should wait?**
- Heavily customized MAS 8 deployments (6+ months of testing needed)
- Organizations without dedicated upgrade resources

---

## Major Features and Changes

### 1. Unified AppPoints Licensing 🎯

**What changed:**
- Old model: Separate licenses for Manage, Health, Predict, Monitor, etc.
- New model: Single AppPoints pool consumed across all applications

**Why it matters:**
- More flexible resource allocation
- Easier to scale usage across modules
- Simplified procurement process

**Example pricing:**
```
Previous MAS 8:
- 100 Manage users: $15,000/month
- 25 Predict users: $8,000/month
- Total: $23,000/month

MAS 9 AppPoints:
- 1,000 AppPoints: $20,000/month
- Can dynamically allocate across all apps
- Average 15% savings for multi-app deployments
```

### 2. React-Based UI Framework 🎨

The entire Manage interface has been rebuilt using React, replacing the legacy Dojo framework.

**Performance improvements:**
- 40% faster page load times
- Smoother mobile experience
- Better offline capabilities

**Developer benefits:**
- Modern JavaScript stack
- Easier customization
- Better debugging tools

**Migration impact:**
- Custom scripts may require updates
- UI customizations need review
- Testing critical for upgraded environments

### 3. Enhanced AI and Watson Integration 🤖

MAS 9 deepens integration with IBM Watson Studio and Cloud Pak for Data.

**New AI capabilities:**

#### Predictive Maintenance 2.0
- Multi-asset failure correlation
- Root cause analysis automation
- What-if scenario modeling

#### Natural Language Query
Users can now ask questions in plain English:

```
User: "Show me all pumps with vibration alerts in the last 30 days"
Maximo: [Returns filtered work orders + map visualization]

User: "What's the average repair cost for HVAC units?"
Maximo: [Shows cost breakdown with trend chart]
```

#### Automated Work Order Generation
AI now suggests:
- Priority levels based on asset criticality
- Required parts from historical repairs
- Optimal technician assignment
- Estimated completion time

**Configuration example:**
```yaml
# mas9-ai-config.yaml
predictive_maintenance:
  enabled: true
  models:
    - asset_class: PUMP
      algorithm: gradient_boost
      retrain_interval: 7d
      alert_threshold: 0.75

  auto_wo_generation:
    enabled: true
    min_confidence: 0.85
    notification_channels:
      - email
      - mobile_push
```

### 4. Mobile Experience Overhaul 📱

**Offline-First Architecture:**
- Work offline for up to 7 days
- Automatic sync when online
- Conflict resolution UI

**New Mobile Features:**
- Augmented reality for asset identification
- Voice-to-text for work logs
- Barcode/QR scanning built-in
- Digital signature capture

**Performance:**
- 60% smaller app size
- Works on 3G connections
- Battery usage reduced 30%

### 5. Integration Platform Enhancements 🔗

**New REST API v3:**
- GraphQL support for complex queries
- Webhook notifications
- Bulk operations endpoint
- Better error handling

**Example GraphQL query:**
```graphql
query {
  workOrders(status: "INPRG", priority: "HIGH") {
    wonum
    description
    asset {
      assetnum
      location
      lastPM
    }
    assignments {
      technician {
        name
        skillLevel
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Integration Connectors:**
- SAP S/4HANA (new)
- ServiceNow (enhanced)
- Salesforce (new)
- Azure IoT Hub (new)
- AWS IoT Core (new)

## Breaking Changes ⚠️

### API Changes

**Deprecated endpoints:**
```
❌ /maximo/api/os/mxasset
✅ /maximo/api/v3/assets

❌ /maximo/api/os/mxwotrack
✅ /maximo/api/v3/workorders
```

**Authentication:**
- OAuth 2.1 required (OAuth 2.0 deprecated)
- API keys must be rotated to new format
- Session timeout reduced to 4 hours (was 8 hours)

### Database Schema Changes

**New required indexes:**
- `WORKORDER.REPORTDATE_IDX`
- `ASSET.CRITICALITY_IDX`
- `LOCATIONS.SITEID_TYPE_IDX`

**Migration script:**
```sql
-- Run before MAS 9 upgrade
CREATE INDEX WORKORDER_REPORTDATE_IDX ON WORKORDER(REPORTDATE, STATUS);
CREATE INDEX ASSET_CRITICALITY_IDX ON ASSET(CRITICALITY, SITEID);
CREATE INDEX LOCATIONS_SITEID_TYPE_IDX ON LOCATIONS(SITEID, TYPE);

-- Update statistics
RUNSTATS ON TABLE WORKORDER WITH DISTRIBUTION;
RUNSTATS ON TABLE ASSET WITH DISTRIBUTION;
```

### Customization Impact

**Automation scripts:**
- Jython 2.7 deprecated (use Python 3.9+)
- Some Java APIs changed
- New security sandbox for scripts

**Testing checklist:**
```
□ Test all custom automation scripts
□ Verify integration endpoints
□ Check mobile app configurations
□ Validate report queries
□ Test SSO/LDAP authentication
□ Verify custom workflows
```

## Migration Guide

### From MAS 8 to MAS 9

**Prerequisites:**
- MAS 8.11+ (upgrade to latest MAS 8 first if needed)
- OpenShift 4.14+
- Database backup completed
- All integrations documented

**Step-by-step process:**

1. **Backup everything**
```bash
# Backup Maximo database
db2 backup database MAXDB to /backups/pre-mas9

# Export MAS configuration
oc get configmaps -n mas-core -o yaml > mas8-config-backup.yaml
oc get secrets -n mas-core -o yaml > mas8-secrets-backup.yaml
```

2. **Run upgrade preflight checks**
```bash
# Download MAS 9 upgrade checker
curl -o mas9-preflight.sh https://ibm.com/support/mas9-preflight
chmod +x mas9-preflight.sh

# Run validation
./mas9-preflight.sh --source-version 8.11 --target-version 9.0
```

3. **Execute upgrade**
```bash
# Apply MAS 9 operator
oc apply -f mas9-operator.yaml

# Trigger upgrade
oc patch Suite mas-instance -n mas-core \
  --type='merge' \
  -p '{"spec":{"version":"9.0.0"}}'

# Monitor upgrade progress
oc get suite mas-instance -n mas-core -w
```

4. **Post-upgrade validation**
- [ ] Login to Manage UI
- [ ] Run smoke tests
- [ ] Verify integrations
- [ ] Check mobile apps
- [ ] Test custom scripts

## Known Issues and Workarounds

### Issue 1: Slow initial login after upgrade

**Symptoms:** First login takes 60+ seconds

**Workaround:**
```bash
# Clear application cache
oc delete pods -l app=maximo-manage -n mas-core
```

### Issue 2: Custom icons missing

**Cause:** Icon library path changed

**Fix:**
```javascript
// Old path (MAS 8)
/maximo/ui/img/custom-icons/

// New path (MAS 9)
/maximo/ui/v9/assets/custom-icons/

// Update icon references in custom apps
```

### Issue 3: Mobile sync errors with large datasets

**Temporary limit:** Reduce sync dataset size to 10,000 records

**Permanent fix:** Expected in MAS 9.1 (Q2 2026)

## Should You Upgrade?

### ✅ Upgrade if:
- You're on MAS 8.10+ with minimal customizations
- You need the new AI features
- Mobile workforce is critical
- You can dedicate 2-4 weeks for testing

### ⏸️ Wait if:
- Heavy customizations (20+ custom apps)
- Integration partners haven't certified MAS 9 compatibility
- Limited upgrade resources
- MAS 9.1 features are critical for your use case

### 🚫 Don't upgrade if:
- Still on Maximo 7.6 or earlier (migrate to MAS 8 first)
- Custom scripts rely on deprecated APIs (fix first)
- No OpenShift cluster available
