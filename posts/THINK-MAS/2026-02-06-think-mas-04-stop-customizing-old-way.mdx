faqs:
  - question: "Can I still use custom Java MBOs in MAS 9?"
    answer: "Custom Java MBOs with direct SQL are incompatible with MAS, especially in SaaS. Automation scripts (Python/JavaScript) replace 80% of custom Java with better maintainability. Custom Java is only supported in strict patterns and should be the exception, not the rule."
  - question: "What replaces database triggers in MAS 9?"
    answer: "Automation scripts with object launch points replace database triggers. They fire on the same events (save, status change, etc.) but operate within the application layer, respecting security, caching, and audit trails. Unlike triggers, they are version-controllable and upgrade-safe."
  - question: "Is the 2-3x initial redesign effort for MAS customizations worth it?"
    answer: "Yes. Organizations that modernize customizations report 40-60% reduction in ongoing support costs within 12-18 months, plus the ability to adopt quarterly MAS updates without multi-month upgrade projects that plagued 7.6.x."

keyTakeaways:
  - "Legacy patterns must go -- database triggers, custom Java with direct SQL, and direct database integrations are all incompatible with MAS"
  - "Automation scripts replace 80% of custom Java with better maintainability and upgrade safety"
  - "API-first everything -- REST and GraphQL for integrations, no direct database access"
  - "Configuration over code -- domains, conditions, and no-code tools should be the first choice"
  - "The 2-3x initial redesign investment pays for itself within 12-18 months through reduced support costs"

# Stop Customizing Maximo the Old Way: Replace Third-Party Tools, Java, and Database Tricks

**Series:** Modern Maximo - Transforming from Legacy 7.x to MAS 9, Cloud-Native, and AI-Driven EAM | **Part 4 of 12**

**Read Time:** 12-15 minutes

> **Who this is for:** Maximo developers, customization architects, and technical leads who currently rely on Java MBOs, database triggers, direct SQL, or third-party customization tools -- and need to understand what replaces them in MAS 9.

---

> **The bottom line:** If your customization strategy depends on direct database access, custom Java MBOs, or database triggers, your MAS migration will fail. This blog shows you the path forward.

---

## The Customization Crisis

> **Dev:** "I'll extend the WORKORDER MBO like always."

> **Architect:** "That won't work in MAS. Use automation scripts."

> **Dev:** "But I need database access!"

> **Architect:** "No direct database access. Use the API."

> **Dev:** "This will take 3x longer!"

> **Architect:** "Yes. And work 3x better."

**The tension:** Legacy patterns worked and were fast--but they're wrong for MAS.

---

## Quick Reference: Legacy to MAS-Safe

| Legacy Pattern | MAS Replacement |
| --- | --- |
| Custom Java MBOs | Automation Scripts (Python/JS) |
| Database Triggers | Automation Scripts + Events |
| Direct SQL Queries | MboSet API + REST/GraphQL |
| JDBC Integrations | REST API + OAuth |
| File System Access | DOCLINKS + Object Storage |
| Hardcoded Config | System Properties + K8s Secrets |

---

## Why Database-Level Tools Are Dead

> **MAS locks down the database.** SaaS model, container immutability, and operator-managed upgrades mean no more direct schema modifications.

---

## The Five Deadly Anti-Patterns

### Anti-Pattern 1: Custom MBO Extensions with Direct SQL

**The Legacy 7.6.x Way:**

```java
public class MyWorkOrderSet extends WorkOrderSet {
    public void customValidation() throws MXException {
        // Direct SQL query - DANGEROUS!
        SqlFormat sql = new SqlFormat(
            "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM MAXIMO.ASSET WHERE ASSETNUM = :1"
        );
        sql.setObject(1, "ASSETNUM", "STRING", getString("ASSETNUM"));
        MXResultSet rs = getDatabase().executeQuery(sql);
        // validation logic...
    }
}
```

**Why This Fails in MAS:**

- Direct database access is blocked in containerized environments
- MBO extensions don't survive upgrades cleanly
- Doesn't scale in microservices architecture
- Completely broken in SaaS (zero database access)
- Bypasses caching, security, and optimization layers

**The MAS Way: Automation Script**

```python
# Object Launch Point: WORKORDER, Save Event, Before Save

if mbo.toBeAdded() or mbo.isModified("ASSETNUM"):
    assetnum = mbo.getString("ASSETNUM")

    # Use MboSet instead of SQL - respects security, caching, everything
    assetSet = mbo.getMboSet("ASSET")
    if assetSet.isEmpty():
        errorgroup = 'asset'
        errorkey = 'assetnotfound'
```

---

### Anti-Pattern 2: Database Triggers for Business Logic

**The Legacy 7.6.x Way:**

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER update_asset_repair_date
AFTER UPDATE ON MAXIMO.WORKORDER
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    IF :NEW.STATUS = 'COMP' THEN
        UPDATE MAXIMO.ASSET
        SET LASTREPAIREDDATE = SYSDATE
        WHERE ASSETNUM = :NEW.ASSETNUM;
    END IF;
END;
```

**Why This Fails in MAS:**

- Database is sealed--you literally cannot add triggers
- Triggers bypass all application logic and security
- Invisible to API consumers and audit trails
- Cannot be version controlled properly
- 100% broken in SaaS

**The MAS Way: Automation Script with Launch Point**

```python
# Object Launch Point: WORKORDER, Status Change, After Save

if mbo.getString("STATUS") == "COMP":
    assetnum = mbo.getString("ASSETNUM")

    if assetnum:
        assetSet = mbo.getMboSet("ASSET")
        if not assetSet.isEmpty():
            asset = assetSet.getMbo(0)
            asset.setValue("LASTREPAIREDDATE", mbo.getDate("ACTFINISH"))
```

---

### Anti-Pattern 3: Direct Database Integration

**The Legacy 7.6.x Way:**

```python
# External reporting tool connecting directly to Maximo DB
import cx_Oracle

connection = cx_Oracle.connect('maximo/password@maxdb')
cursor = connection.cursor()

cursor.execute("""
    SELECT WONUM, DESCRIPTION, STATUS
    FROM MAXIMO.WORKORDER
    WHERE SITEID = 'MAIN' AND STATUS IN ('WAPPR', 'APPR')
""")
```

**Why This Fails in MAS:**

- No external database connections allowed
- Bypasses authentication, authorization, and encryption
- No audit trail for data access
- Schema changes break everything
- Completely impossible in SaaS

**The MAS Way: REST API Integration**

```python
import requests

# Proper API-based integration
base_url = "https://mas-instance.example.com/maximo/oslc/os/mxwo"
headers = {
    "apikey": os.getenv("MAXIMO_API_KEY"),
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
params = {
    "oslc.where": 'siteid="MAIN" and status in ["WAPPR","APPR"]',
    "oslc.select": "wonum,description,status"
}

response = requests.get(base_url, headers=headers, params=params)
work_orders = response.json()["member"]
```

> **Key insight:** The three most common anti-patterns -- custom MBOs with direct SQL, database triggers, and direct database integrations -- share a common flaw: they bypass the application layer entirely. In MAS, the application layer IS the only access path. Every pattern that skips it is fundamentally incompatible, not just inconvenient.

---

### Anti-Pattern 4: File System Dependencies

**The Legacy 7.6.x Way:**

```java
public void exportReport() {
    String filePath = "/opt/IBM/SMP/maximo/reports/output/report.pdf";
    File reportFile = new File(filePath);
    // Write report to filesystem
}
```

**Why This Fails in MAS:**

- Containers have no persistent file system
- Pods can be destroyed and recreated at any moment
- Hardcoded paths don't exist in cloud environments
- Doesn't scale horizontally
- Broken in SaaS

**The MAS Way: Object Storage**

```python
# Use Maximo's DOCLINKS for attachments
doclinks = mbo.getMboSet("DOCLINKS")
doc = doclinks.add()

doc.setValue("DOCUMENT", "ReportOutput")
doc.setValue("DOCTYPE", "Attachments")
doc.setValue("URLNAME", "report_" + mbo.getString("WONUM") + ".pdf")

# Or use external object storage (S3, Azure Blob, etc.)
import boto3
s3 = boto3.client('s3')
s3.upload_file('local_report.pdf', 'maximo-reports', f'reports/{wonum}.pdf')
```

---

### Anti-Pattern 5: Hardcoded Configuration

**The Legacy 7.6.x Way:**

```java
public class IntegrationService {
    private static final String ENDPOINT = "http://erp.company.com/api";
    private static final String API_KEY = "sk-12345abcde";  // Security nightmare!
}
```

**Why This Fails in MAS:**

- Can't change config without recompiling
- Credentials in source code (audit failure waiting to happen)
- Different values needed per environment
- Doesn't work with secrets management
- Major security and compliance risk

**The MAS Way: Property/Secret Management**

```python
# Automation Script using System Properties
from psdi.server import MXServer

endpoint = MXServer.getMXServer().getProperty("custom.erp.endpoint")
username = MXServer.getMXServer().getProperty("custom.erp.username")

# For sensitive data, use encrypted properties or external secrets
import os
api_key = os.getenv("ERP_API_KEY")  # Injected by Kubernetes secrets
```

> **Key insight:** Every anti-pattern has a MAS-safe replacement. The shift is consistent: move from infrastructure-level access (filesystem, database, hardcoded config) to application-level access (APIs, DOCLINKS, system properties, Kubernetes secrets). The MAS way is more work upfront but dramatically more maintainable, scalable, and upgrade-safe.

## MAS Customization Toolbox

### Automation Scripts

Replaces 80% of custom Java. Use for validation, defaults, workflow logic, and integrations.

| Launch Point | Use Case |
| --- | --- |
| Object | Business logic on records |
| Attribute | Field-level validation |
| Action | Toolbar buttons, escalations |
| Library | Reusable modules |

---

### Domains & Conditions

No-code logic for dynamic dropdowns and field restrictions.

---

### Conditional UI Expressions

Show/hide fields, set read-only, or require fields based on conditions.

---

### Integration Framework

**Outbound:** REST, GraphQL, Kafka, Webhooks | **Inbound:** REST, Kafka subscriptions

---

## MAS-Safe Checklist

- [ ]  No direct database access or triggers
- [ ]  API-first integrations
- [ ]  No file system dependencies
- [ ]  No hardcoded values or credentials
- [ ]  Works in SaaS (stateless, scalable)
- [ ]  Upgrade-safe

---

## ROI Summary

**Short-term:** 2-3x initial effort for redesign

**Long-term:** Quarterly upgrades (vs. 6-12 month projects), 40-60% support cost reduction, SaaS-ready, audit-compliant

> **Key insight:** The 2-3x initial redesign investment pays for itself within 12-18 months. Organizations that modernize their customizations report 40-60% reduction in ongoing support costs, plus the ability to adopt quarterly MAS updates without the multi-month upgrade projects that plagued 7.6.x.

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Legacy patterns must go** -- database triggers, custom Java, direct SQL are all incompatible
2. **Automation scripts replace 80%** of custom Java with better maintainability
3. **API-first everything** -- REST/GraphQL for integrations, no direct DB access
4. **Configuration over code** -- domains, conditions, and no-code tools first
