faqs:
  - question: "Will my job disappear if IBM manages the infrastructure?"
    answer: "No. Your job transforms. Someone needs to operate MAS within your organization—manage configurations, monitor performance, handle incidents, plan capacity. Your Maximo domain knowledge is irreplaceable; the tools change."
  - question: "How much Kubernetes do I need to learn?"
    answer: "Enough to be operationally effective—not infrastructure-engineer level. Focus on pods, deployments, logs, resources, and the oc/kubectl commands you'll use daily. You don't need to design Kubernetes clusters."
  - question: "What happens when things break at 3 AM?"
    answer: "You still get called. The difference: instead of SSH and WebSphere console, you'll use oc commands, Prometheus alerts, and Grafana dashboards. The troubleshooting mindset transfers; the tools are different."
  - question: "Should I pursue Kubernetes certification?"
    answer: "Helpful but not essential. CKA (Certified Kubernetes Administrator) is valuable if you want deep platform work. For Maximo-focused operations, Red Hat OpenShift certification or IBM MAS certifications may be more relevant."

keyTakeaways:
  - "Your job transforms from infrastructure owner to platform operator"
  - "Shared responsibility means IBM handles more, but you still own outcomes"
  - "Kubernetes knowledge is practical, not theoretical—learn what you'll use"
  - "Observability replaces traditional monitoring and debugging"
  - "Your Maximo expertise plus cloud skills makes you uniquely valuable"

# From WebSphere Admin to Platform Engineer: The Maximo Admin's Evolution

> **Your job title might change, but you're more valuable than ever.**

If you've spent years as a Maximo administrator—managing WebSphere, tuning databases, handling upgrades, troubleshooting production issues—the move to MAS raises existential questions. If IBM runs the platform, what do you do? If containers replace servers, what happens to your skills?

This blog addresses these questions directly. Your role doesn't disappear; it evolves. The organizations that succeed with MAS will be those with people who understand both Maximo and cloud operations. That's you—if you're willing to learn.

## The Traditional Admin Role: What Defined You

Let's honor what you've built. Maximo administration in the 7.6 world was complex, demanding, and required deep expertise.

### Your Domain

**Infrastructure Management:**
- WebSphere Application Server configuration
- JVM tuning, garbage collection optimization
- Cluster management, session replication
- Load balancer configuration

**Database Administration:**
- DB2, Oracle, or SQL Server management
- Query optimization, index tuning
- Backup and recovery procedures
- Storage management

**Maximo Operations:**
- Patch application and upgrade planning
- Performance monitoring and troubleshooting
- Security configuration (LDAP, SSL, users, groups)
- CRON task management
- Log analysis and debugging

**The 3 AM Calls:**
- Application hung? Thread dump analysis
- Database slow? Execution plan review
- Integration failed? Queue investigation
- Users can't login? LDAP/security debugging

You were the person who kept Maximo running. That responsibility doesn't go away—but how you fulfill it changes.

## The Shared Responsibility Model: Who Does What

MAS operates on a shared responsibility model. Understanding the boundaries is crucial.

### The Responsibility Matrix

![Shared Responsibility Model](./images/diag-blog4-shared-responsibility.png)

### What This Means for You

**You're not responsible for:**
- Patching WebSphere (there is no WebSphere)
- Building Maximo EAR files
- Managing JVM versions
- Container security scanning (IBM handles)

**You're still responsible for:**
- Ensuring MAS meets business SLAs
- Responding to incidents
- Planning capacity for growth
- Managing user access
- Configuring integrations
- Performance optimization

**The shift:** Less infrastructure plumbing, more platform operations and business alignment.

## New Responsibilities: What Admins Do in MAS

### Operator Management

MAS uses Kubernetes Operators—automated controllers that manage application lifecycle.

**Key operators you'll interact with:**
- **IBM Maximo Application Suite Operator**: Core MAS management
- **IBM Maximo Manage Operator**: Manage-specific functions
- **MongoDB Operator**: Database for some MAS components
- **Kafka Operator**: Event streaming infrastructure

**Your role:**
- Understand operator status and health
- Configure operator parameters
- Troubleshoot operator-related issues
- Plan and execute operator upgrades

**Example: Checking operator status**
```bash
# List operators
oc get csv -n mas-instance

# Check MAS operator health
oc get pods -n mas-instance | grep operator

# View operator logs
oc logs -n mas-instance deployment/ibm-mas-operator -f
```

### Platform Observability

Traditional monitoring tools (Tivoli, custom scripts) give way to platform-native observability.

**The Three Pillars:**

**1. Logs**
- Aggregated across all pods
- Searchable via OpenShift console or external tools (Elasticsearch, Splunk)
- No more SSH to find log files

```bash
# View Manage pod logs
oc logs -n mas-manage-instance deployment/manage-server -f

# Search logs for errors
oc logs -n mas-manage-instance deployment/manage-server | grep ERROR
```

**2. Metrics**
- Prometheus collects automatically
- Grafana dashboards visualize
- CPU, memory, request latency, custom metrics

```yaml
# Example Prometheus query: MAS response time
histogram_quantile(0.95,
  sum(rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{app="manage"}[5m]))
  by (le)
)
```

**3. Traces**
- Request flow across services
- Identify bottlenecks
- Jaeger or similar for distributed tracing

### Capacity Planning in Kubernetes

Instead of "we need a bigger server," you think in terms of:

**Resource Requests and Limits:**
```yaml
resources:
  requests:
    memory: "4Gi"
    cpu: "2"
  limits:
    memory: "8Gi"
    cpu: "4"
```

**Horizontal Pod Autoscaling:**
```yaml
# Scale based on CPU usage
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: manage-hpa
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: manage-server
  minReplicas: 3
  maxReplicas: 10
  metrics:
  - type: Resource
    resource:
      name: cpu
      target:
        type: Utilization
        averageUtilization: 70
```

**Your planning questions:**
- How many concurrent users at peak?
- What's the resource profile of typical workloads?
- How quickly do we need to scale for demand spikes?
- What's our cost model for additional capacity?

### Security in Containerized Environments

Security model changes but doesn't simplify.

**What's different:**
- Pod security policies replace server hardening
- Network policies replace firewall rules
- Secrets management replaces file-based credentials
- RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) at Kubernetes level

**What you manage:**
- User authentication (SSO, LDAP integration)
- MAS security groups and permissions
- API access controls
- Encryption at rest and in transit configuration

```bash
# Check network policies
oc get networkpolicies -n mas-instance

# Review secrets
oc get secrets -n mas-instance

# Check RBAC
oc get rolebindings -n mas-instance
```

### Priority Learning Path

**Week 1-2: Kubernetes Fundamentals**

You don't need to design clusters, but understand:

```bash
# Essential commands
oc get pods                    # List running workloads
oc describe pod <name>         # Detailed pod info
oc logs <pod>                  # View logs
oc exec -it <pod> -- /bin/bash # Shell into container
oc get events                  # Cluster events
oc top pods                    # Resource usage
```

**Key concepts:**
- Pods (smallest deployable unit)
- Deployments (manage pod replicas)
- Services (network access to pods)
- ConfigMaps and Secrets (configuration)
- Persistent Volumes (storage)

**Week 3-4: OpenShift Specifics**

OpenShift adds enterprise features:
- Routes (external access)
- Projects (namespaces with extras)
- Security Context Constraints
- Built-in monitoring
- Web console

**Practice:**
- Navigate OpenShift console
- Deploy a test application
- Set up resource quotas
- Configure routes

**Week 5-6: Observability Stack**

- Prometheus basics (metrics, queries)
- Grafana dashboard creation
- Alert configuration
- Log aggregation patterns

**Week 7-8: MAS-Specific Operations**

- MAS operator management
- Manage configuration
- Backup and restore procedures
- Upgrade processes

## Career Path: Where Experienced Admins Add Value

### The Hybrid Expert

Organizations migrating to MAS desperately need people who understand:
- How Maximo works (business logic, configuration, data model)
- How cloud platforms work (containers, orchestration, observability)

This combination is rare. Pure cloud engineers don't understand Maximo. Long-time Maximo admins are learning cloud. You can become the bridge.

### Migration Project Leadership

Every MAS migration needs technical leadership from someone who:
- Knows what exists in the current environment
- Can assess migration risks
- Understands operational requirements
- Can train the team on new patterns

That's a senior role with significant impact.

### Operational Excellence in MAS

Post-migration, organizations need people who:
- Establish operational standards
- Build monitoring and alerting
- Create runbooks for common issues
- Optimize performance and cost
- Train others
