faqs:
  - question: "Why can't I use direct database access for MAS integrations?"
    answer: "MAS uses a sealed database architecture with containerized deployment. Direct SQL, JDBC, and shared-folder file drops are blocked by design. All integration must go through REST APIs, GraphQL, Kafka events, or iPaaS tools like IBM App Connect."
  - question: "How much faster is GraphQL compared to REST for Maximo queries?"
    answer: "GraphQL can reduce API calls by up to 85% and response times by 86% compared to multiple sequential REST calls, because you request exactly the data you need in a single query instead of chaining 5-7 separate REST endpoints."
  - question: "Should I migrate all integrations at once to MAS?"
    answer: "No. Use a phased 12-month migration: tackle critical database integrations first (months 1-3), then file-based integrations (months 4-6), advanced event-driven patterns (months 7-9), and optimization (months 10-12). Always run legacy and modern integrations in parallel for 2 months before cutover."

keyTakeaways:
  - "Legacy integration patterns (direct DB, file drops, JDBC) are incompatible with MAS sealed architecture"
  - "REST APIs are the primary integration mechanism across all MAS applications including Manage, Monitor, Health, and Predict"
  - "GraphQL delivers 85% reduction in API calls by requesting exactly the data needed in a single query"
  - "Kafka enables real-time event-driven integrations replacing batch polling with push notifications"
  - "IBM App Connect included with MAS provides low-code integration with 100+ pre-built connectors"
  - "Phased 12-month migration with parallel runs is critical -- never attempt big-bang integration migration"
  - "Security fundamentals are non-negotiable: API keys, TLS 1.2+, secret management, and rate limiting"

# Integration Modernization: Building API-First, Event-Driven MAS Integrations

**Series:** Modern Maximo - Transforming from Legacy 7.x to MAS 9, Cloud-Native, and AI-Driven EAM | **Part 5 of 12**

**Read Time:** 15-20 minutes

---

> **Who this is for:** Maximo integration architects, middleware engineers, and technical leads responsible for connecting Maximo to ERP, GIS, SCADA, and other enterprise systems -- especially teams planning or actively executing a migration from 7.6.x to MAS 9.

> **The Mindset Shift:** This blog is about changing how you *think* about integrations -- from database-centric to API-first, from batch to event-driven, from monolithic to cloud-native.

---

## Introduction: The Integration Transformation Nobody Talks About

A utilities company spent 18 months and $2.5M migrating to MAS 9. Three months after go-live, they discovered their "successful" migration was actually failing:

- **SAP integration:** Still querying the Maximo database directly--except now it couldn't
- **GIS system:** File drops to shared folders--which don't exist in containers
- **SCADA system:** JDBC connections--blocked by IBM security policies
- **Mobile workforce:** Direct database writes--causing data corruption
- **Reporting:** SQL queries--returning incomplete results

> **Impact:** $400K in emergency remediation. Six-month delay. Executive escalation. Near-total integration rewrite.

**Root cause:** They migrated Maximo, but they didn't modernize their integrations.

> **Key insight:** Migrating Maximo without modernizing integrations is like upgrading the engine but leaving the old transmission -- the system cannot deliver power where it needs to go.

This blog explains how to get integration right the first time--covering API strategies across all MAS applications: Manage, Monitor, Health, Predict, Assist, and Visual Inspection.

## Key Technical Highlights

### REST API Examples Across MAS

**Maximo Manage - Complex Query:**

```jsx
GET /maximo/api/os/mxwo?
  oslc.select=wonum,description,status,asset{assetnum,location{description}}
  &oslc.where=status in ["WAPPR","APPR"] and wopriority<3
  &oslc.pageSize=50
```

**Monitor - IoT Device Registration:**

```
POST /api/monitor/v1/devices
{
  "deviceId": "PUMP-001-SENSOR",
  "deviceType": "TemperatureSensor",
  "metadata": {
    "assetnum": "PUMP-001"
  }
}
```

**Health - Asset Health Scores:**

```
GET /api/health/v1/assets/PUMP-001/health
{
  "healthScore": 72,
  "criticality": "HIGH",
  "riskScore": 45
}
```

**Predict - Failure Predictions:**

```
GET /api/predict/v1/assets/PUMP-001/predictions
{
  "failureMode": "Bearing Failure",
  "probability": 0.68,
  "daysToFailure": 14
}
```

---

### GraphQL Performance Advantage

**REST (7 API calls, ~2.1 seconds):**

```jsx
const wo = await fetch('/api/os/mxwo/1234');
const asset = await fetch(`/api/os/mxapiasset/${wo.assetnum}`);
const location = await fetch(`/api/os/mxapilocation/${asset.location}`);
// ... 4 more calls
```

**GraphQL (1 API call, ~0.3 seconds):**

```graphql
{
  workorder(wonum: "1234") {
    wonum
    description
    asset {
      assetnum
      location {
        description
        siteid
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> **Result:** 85% reduction in API calls, 86% reduction in response time

---

### Kafka Event-Driven Pattern

**Monitor Detects Anomaly -> Publishes to Kafka -> Manage Auto-Creates Work Order**

```jsx
// Consumer in Manage listening for anomalies
const consumer = kafka.consumer({ groupId: 'manage-anomaly-handler' });

await consumer.subscribe({ topic: 'monitor.*.anomaly.detected' });

await consumer.run({
  eachMessage: async ({ message }) => {
    const anomaly = JSON.parse(message.value.toString());

    // Auto-create work order for high-severity anomalies
    if (anomaly.severity === 'CRITICAL') {
      await fetch('/maximo/api/os/mxwo', {
        method: 'POST',
        body: JSON.stringify({
          assetnum: anomaly.assetnum,
          description: `Anomaly detected: ${anomaly.anomalyType}`,
          worktype: 'CM',
          wopriority: 1
        })
      });
    }
  }
});
```

---

## Real-World Integration Patterns

### Pattern 1: ERP Integration (Full Bidirectional Sync)

**From Maximo to ERP:**

- Work orders completed -> Create invoices
- Material issues -> Update inventory
- Purchase requisitions -> Create POs

**From ERP to Maximo:**

- New assets purchased -> Create in Maximo
- Vendor changes -> Update Maximo vendors
- Employee terminations -> Deactivate labor records

**Implementation:** IBM App Connect with pre-built SAP connector

---

### Pattern 2: GIS Integration (Spatial Synchronization)

**Maximo to GIS:**

```jsx
// Automation Script: Create GIS feature when asset added
var gisFeature = {
  "geometry": {
    "x": mbo.getDouble("LONGITUDE"),
    "y": mbo.getDouble("LATITUDE")
  },
  "attributes": {
    "AssetNumber": mbo.getString("ASSETNUM"),
    "Description": mbo.getString("DESCRIPTION")
  }
};

callRESTAPI(
  "https://gis.company.com/server/rest/services/Assets/FeatureServer/0/addFeatures",
  "POST",
  {"features": [gisFeature]}
);
```

---

### Pattern 3: SCADA/IoT Integration (Real-Time Events)

**Flow:** IoT Device -> MQTT -> Monitor -> Kafka -> Manage

1. Device publishes telemetry to MQTT
2. Monitor ingests and analyzes data
3. Anomaly detected -> Publishes to Kafka
4. Manage consumes event -> Auto-creates work order

> **Result:** Sub-second response time from sensor anomaly to work order creation

---

## Migration Strategy

### 4-Phase Approach (12 Months)

**Phase 1: Critical Database Integrations (Months 1-3)**

- ERP financial interfaces
- Mobile workforce sync
- Real-time SCADA/IoT
- **Goal:** Eliminate all database dependencies

**Phase 2: File-Based Integrations (Months 4-6)**

- GIS synchronization
- Batch imports/exports
- Legacy report generation
- **Goal:** Move to API + iPaaS

**Phase 3: Advanced Patterns (Months 7-9)**

- Event-driven workflows
- Complex orchestrations
- Multi-system transactions
- **Goal:** Cloud-native architecture

**Phase 4: Optimization (Months 10-12)**

- Performance tuning
- Monitoring enhancement
- Documentation
- **Goal:** Production-ready operations

---

### Parallel Run Strategy

```
Legacy (DB) Integration ----\
                             +--> Compare Results --> Build Confidence
New (API) Integration ------/
```

**Duration:** 2 months of parallel operation before cutover

> **Key insight:** Never attempt a big-bang integration migration. The parallel run strategy -- running legacy and modern integrations side by side for 2 months -- is your safety net that proves the new architecture before you commit.

---

## MAS Integration Maturity Model

**Level 1: Legacy** -- Direct database access, file-based, no monitoring

**Level 2: API-Enabled** -- REST API adoption, basic authentication

**Level 3: Event-Driven** -- Kafka integration, automated retry, monitoring

**Level 4: Cloud-Native** -- Full API-first, event sourcing, API gateway, DevOps

**Level 5: Intelligent** -- AI-powered mapping, self-healing, predictive monitoring

> **Key insight:** Most organizations are at Level 1-2. The goal for MAS migration is to reach Level 3 (event-driven) minimum -- Level 4 (cloud-native) is where the real operational benefits begin.

---

## Key Takeaways

- **Legacy patterns are MAS-incompatible** -- sealed database, containerized architecture make direct access impossible
- **REST APIs are primary mechanism** across all MAS applications with rich functionality for Manage, Monitor, Health, Predict, Assist, Visual Inspection
- **GraphQL eliminates API inefficiency** -- 85% reduction in API calls by requesting exactly the needed data
- **Kafka enables real-time, scalable integrations** -- event-driven architecture replaces polling with push notifications
- **IBM App Connect (included with MAS)** provides low-code integration with 100+ pre-built connectors
- **Phased migration is critical**: assess -> redesign -> parallel run -> cutover -- never attempt big-bang migration
- **Security is non-negotiable**: API keys, TLS 1.2+, secret management, rate limiting are production requirements
- **Monitoring and observability are essential** -- track API metrics, integration health, error rates continuously
- **Real-world patterns proven across ERP, GIS, SCADA/IoT, HR, mobile workforce** -- each with specific implementation guidance
