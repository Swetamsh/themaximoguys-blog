# The Future of Maximo: From Asset Management to Autonomous Operations

![The Future of Maximo](./images/think-mas-part-12.png)

> **Who this is for:** Maximo professionals, IT strategists, reliability leaders, and anyone invested in the long-term future of enterprise asset management -- whether you are mid-migration or already running MAS 9 and planning what comes next.

**Read Time:** 18-20 minutes

---

## Introduction: The 2035 Vision

It's 2035. You wake to a notification: **"Pump P-104 self-corrected high vibration condition. Work order auto-generated for preventive bearing lubrication in 45 days. Zero production impact."**

This isn't science fiction. The trajectory from Maximo 7.6 to MAS 9 to autonomous operations is already clear. This blog explores where we're going -- and how to prepare.

---

## Part 1: The Evolution of Asset Management

### Five Stages of EAM Maturity

**Stage 1: Reactive (1990s-2000s) - "Fix When Broken"**

```
Characteristics:
- Run to failure
- Emergency maintenance
- Paper-based work orders
- No historical data
- High downtime

Maximo Era: Maximo 4-5 (client-server)
Cost Impact: Highest
Downtime: 15-20% of operational time
```

**Stage 2: Preventive (2000s-2010s) - "Fix on Schedule"**

```
Characteristics:
- Time-based maintenance
- PM schedules
- CMMS adoption
- Basic reporting
- Over-maintenance common

Maximo Era: Maximo 6-7.6
Cost Impact: High (unnecessary PM)
Downtime: 8-12% of operational time
```

**Stage 3: Predictive (2015-2025) - "Fix Before Failure"**

```
Characteristics:
- Condition-based maintenance
- IoT sensors
- AI/ML predictions
- Integration with SCADA
- Optimal timing

Maximo Era: MAS 8-9 (Predict, Monitor, Health)
Cost Impact: Medium
Downtime: 3-6% of operational time
```

**Stage 4: Prescriptive (2025-2030) - "AI Recommends Actions"**

```
Characteristics:
- AI suggests specific actions
- Digital twins simulate outcomes
- Multi-modal inspections
- Autonomous work order generation
- Human approves AI recommendations

Maximo Era: MAS 9.1-10 (Maximo Assistant, watsonx)
Cost Impact: Low
Downtime: 1-3% of operational time
```

**Stage 5: Autonomous (2030-2040) - "Self-Healing Assets"**

```
Characteristics:
- AI executes corrections automatically
- Self-healing systems
- Predictive + prescriptive + autonomous
- Human oversight only
- Near-zero unplanned downtime

Maximo Era: MAS 11+ (AI agents, autonomous operations)

Downtime: <1% of operational time
```

**We are currently between Stage 3 and Stage 4.**

> **Key insight:** The five-stage EAM evolution from Reactive to Autonomous is not speculation -- it is a trajectory already underway. Each stage cuts downtime roughly in half: from 15-20% (Reactive) to less than 1% (Autonomous). Organizations that begin positioning for Stage 4 (Prescriptive) today will have a 5-year head start on competitors who wait.

---

## Part 2: Near-Term Future (2025-2028)

### 1. Maximo Assistant Becomes Universal

**MAS 9.1 introduced watsonx-powered Maximo Assistant:**

```
Current Capabilities (2025):
- Natural language queries: "Which work orders are missing job plans?"
- Data analysis: "Show sum of total cost per site"
- Quick insights without leaving Maximo

Near-Term Evolution (2026-2028):
- Proactive suggestions: "3 critical WOs need attention"
- Mobile integration: Voice-based queries from field
- Role-specific: Tailored for technicians vs planners vs managers
- Multi-lingual: 50+ languages
- Contextual awareness: Knows your role, site, assets
```

**2028 Technician Experience:**

```
Technician: "Assistant, why did motor M-45 fail?"
Assistant: "Bearing failure. 3 similar failures in 18 months.
           Root cause: Inadequate lubrication.
           I've created a PM for quarterly lubrication.
           WO-54782 already generated for bearing replacement.
           Parts ordered, ETA 2 hours.
           Estimated repair time: 3.5 hours based on similar WOs."

Technician: "Show me the procedure."
Assistant: [Displays step-by-step with AR overlays]
```

## Final Thoughts

This series began with a simple premise: **Legacy Maximo thinking doesn't work in MAS 9.**

We end with a bolder statement: **MAS 9 thinking won't work in the autonomous future.**

The organizations that thrive won't be those with the best technology -- they'll be those that successfully partner humans with AI, embrace autonomous operations, and continuously evolve their capabilities.

The future of asset management isn't about managing assets. It's about orchestrating autonomous systems that manage themselves, while humans provide oversight, ethics, and strategic direction.

**The transformation from Maximo 7.6 to autonomous operations is a 20-year journey. We're 5 years in. The next 15 will be extraordinary.**

Are you ready?
