## Testing the Blog Script

This is a test post created using the blog management helper script!

### Features Tested

- ✅ Post creation with `./scripts/blog.sh new`
- ✅ Automatic frontmatter generation
- ✅ Proper file naming with date prefix
- ✅ Git integration

### How It Works

The blog script makes it easy to:

1. Create new posts with proper templates
2. List all existing posts
3. Publish changes to GitHub
4. Sync latest content

This workflow keeps code and content separate while maintaining a smooth publishing experience.
