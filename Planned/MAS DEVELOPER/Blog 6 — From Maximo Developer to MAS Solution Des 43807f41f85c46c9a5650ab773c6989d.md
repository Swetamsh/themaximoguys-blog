### 🧑‍💻 Blog 6 - From Maximo Developer to MAS Solution Designer: Skills, Tools, and Career Path

**Category:** MAS DEVELOPER

---

### Purpose of this blog

Help individual contributors see how their role evolves from **Maximo Java developer** to **MAS solution designer**, and what skills to build to stay ahead.

---

### 1. How the Role Is Changing

Old identity:

- "I write Java and extend MBOs."
- "I fix problems by changing code or the database."

New identity:

- "I design end-to-end solutions across MAS, integrations, and mobile."
- "I use configuration, scripts, APIs, and cloud services together."

**Key insight:** Your value is less about lines of Java and more about how well you design reliable, upgradeable solutions on MAS.

---

### 2. Core Skill Areas for MAS Solution Designers

Key domains:

- **MAS architecture basics**: microservices, operators, OpenShift.
- **Automation Scripts**: Python/JavaScript patterns.
- **API and integration design**: REST, events, iPaaS/ESB.
- **Cloud-native concepts**: containers, scaling, observability.
- **Mobile and UX awareness**: Maximo Mobile, role-based flows.

**Key insight:** You do not have to become a Kubernetes admin, but you should understand how MAS behaves in a cloud-native environment.

### 3. Mindset Shifts You Need to Make

From:

- "I own the app server."
- "I can tweak the DB whenever needed."

To:

- "I design within a managed platform with clear boundaries."
- "I collaborate with infra, security, and business teams to find the right pattern."

From:

- "Custom code first."

To:

- "Config and low-code first, custom only where it truly adds value."

---

### 4. Daily Work in MAS: What You Actually Do

Examples of activities:

- Design how a new business process maps to MAS apps, data, and integrations.
- Decide which parts are scripts, which are config, and which are external services.
- Review whether a new requirement is compatible with MAS SaaS constraints.
- Work with architects to select patterns (API-first, event-driven, mobile-first).

**Key insight:** Solution designers spend more time in design diagrams, discussions, and configuration screens than in IDEs.

---

### 5. Building Your MAS Skill Roadmap

Suggestions:

- Short term (0-6 months):
    - Learn MAS basics, automation scripts, and key APIs.
    - Convert a few Java customizations to scripts.
- Medium term (6-18 months):
    - Get comfortable with integration platforms.
    - Participate in MAS architecture and migration discussions.
- Long term (18+ months):
    - Lead solution design for new MAS capabilities.
    - Mentor others on cloud-native and AI-powered patterns.

**Key insight:** Even small steps (like converting one customization the right way) move you toward a solution designer profile.

---

### 6. Positioning Yourself in the MAS and IBM Ecosystem

Ideas:

- Share migration stories and patterns with the community.
- Present internal brown-bags on MAS topics (scripts, integrations, troubleshooting).
- Collaborate with IBM and partners on reference architectures.

**Key insight:** Being visible as a thoughtful MAS solution designer creates opportunities: projects, leadership roles, and community recognition.

---

### Final Takeaways

- MAS rewards **design thinking** more than deep server hacking.
- Your strongest assets are your domain knowledge and ability to pick the right patterns.
- Invest steadily in scripts, APIs, cloud-native, and observability.
- See yourself not just as a developer, but as a key shaper of the MAS journey for your organization.

### Next Actions You Can Take

- Write a short personal roadmap of 3-5 MAS skills you want to build this year.
- Identify one current project where you can act more as a solution designer.
- Share your learnings with your team to start raising the bar for MAS development.
